### applications
a few of my favorite application/fellowship-writing advice resources:
* [NSF-GRFP application guide](http://www.alexhunterlang.com/nsf-fellowship) by Alex Lang
* ["how to apply to grad school" blog post](https://monicagatesblog.wordpress.com/2016/03/14/the-phd-application-post/) by Monica Gates 
* [advice for science fellowship applications: NSF, NDSEG, Hertz](http://www.pgbovine.net/fellowship-tips.htm) by Phillip Guo

### surviving grad school
self-explanatory
* ["a Survival Guide to a PhD"](https://karpathy.github.io/2016/09/07/phd/) by Andre Karpathy
* [PhD Comics](http://phdcomics.com/)

### women in science
in 2016, I attended [Cosyne](cosyne.org) and realized just how few women were in computational neuroscience...here are some great resources that are trying to bring awareness to gender diversity in (neuro)science.
* [womenincocosci.com](http://womenincocosci.com/): advice website for undergraduate women interested in computational and cognitive science (credit to [Monica Gates](http://monicagates.org/)).
* [anneslist.net](https://anneslist.net/): a list of female systems/computational neuroscientists curated by [Anne Churchland](http://churchlandlab.labsites.cshl.edu/).
* [biaswatchneuro.com](https://biaswatchneuro.com/): a website dedicated to elucidating gender biases at neuroscience conferences
* A [list of female neuroscientists and their personal experiences](https://fairhalllab.com/careers/how-does-she-do-it/) on being both academic _and_ domestic (credit to [Adrienne Fairhall](https://fairhalllab.com/)).

### in the press
* A [short blurb](https://www.janelia.org/you-janelia/students-and-postdocs/advice-girls-stem-our-janelia-undergraduate-scholars) by me and other [JUS](https://www.janelia.org/you-janelia/students-postdocs/undergraduate-scholars-program) girls about being in STEM. Also, [this](https://www.janelia.org/meet-2017-janelia-undergraduate-scholars).
* On [my time in the JazLab](http://www.csne-erc.org/engage-enable/post/reu-program-participants-mit-and-sdsu) at MIT.
* [advocating for the creation of a rigorous neuroscience curriculum](http://www.ricethresher.org/article/2017/11/fac-senate-neuroscience-major-vote) at Rice.

### personal
* Every year, I [run a 5K](https://www.lupus.org/action/walk-to-end-lupus-now) to raise awareness about lupus and fundraise for the [Lupus Foundation of America](https://lupus.org/).
* [Some blogs](http://ricecatalyst.org/discoveries/?author=559ed5bfe4b0a37c3cb5967d) on music and neuroscience that I wrote for Discoveries, a section of [Catalyst](http://ricecatalyst.org/), Rice's Undergraduate Science Journal.
* I once [composed some piano music](https://soundcloud.com/lucy_lai).
* sometimes I write [poetry](https://subcorticalsongs.wordpress.com/).
* I also try to keep a regular [blog](https://lucyblogs.wordpress.com/) about various topics.
