### applications
a few of my favorite application/fellowship-writing advice resources:
* [NSF-GRFP application guide](http://www.alexhunterlang.com/nsf-fellowship){:target="_blank"} by Alex Lang
* ["How to apply to grad school" blog post](https://monicagatesblog.wordpress.com/2016/03/14/the-phd-application-post/){:target="_blank"} by Vael Gates
* [All About PhD Applications](https://lucy-lai.com/blog/gradapps){:target="_blank"} by yours truly :-)

### women in science
In 2016, I attended [Cosyne](http://cosyne.org){:target="_blank"} for the first time and realized just how few women were in computational neuroscience...here are some great resources that are trying to bring awareness to gender diversity in (neuro)science.
* [womenincocosci.com](http://womenincocosci.com/){:target="_blank"}: advice website for undergraduate women interested in computational and cognitive science (credit to [Vael Gates](https://vaelgates.com/){:target="_blank"}).
* [compcog.science](http://compcog.science/){:target="_blank"}: a list of minority computational cognitive modellers, curated by [Christina Bergmann](https://sites.google.com/site/chbergma/){:target="_blank"} and [Olivia Guest](http://oliviaguest.com/){:target="_blank"}
* [anneslist.net](https://anneslist.net/){:target="_blank"}: a list of female systems/computational neuroscientists curated by [Anne Churchland](http://churchlandlab.labsites.cshl.edu/){:target="_blank"}.
* [biaswatchneuro.com](https://biaswatchneuro.com/){:target="_blank"}: a website dedicated to elucidating gender biases at neuroscience conferences
* A [list of female neuroscientists and their personal experiences](https://fairhalllab.com/careers/how-does-she-do-it/){:target="_blank"} on being both academic _and_ domestic (credit to [Adrienne Fairhall](https://fairhalllab.com/){:target="_blank"}).

### in the press
* [An interview](https://brain.harvard.edu/hbi_humans/lucy-lai/){:target="_blank"} I did with "Humans of HBI" (Harvard Brain Initative).
* A [short blurb](https://www.janelia.org/you-janelia/students-and-postdocs/advice-girls-stem-our-janelia-undergraduate-scholars){:target="_blank"} by me and other [JUS](https://www.janelia.org/you-janelia/students-postdocs/undergraduate-scholars-program){:target="_blank"} girls about being in STEM. Also, [this](https://www.janelia.org/meet-2017-janelia-undergraduate-scholars){:target="_blank"}.
* On [my time in the JazLab](http://www.csne-erc.org/engage-enable/post/reu-program-participants-mit-and-sdsu){:target="_blank"} at MIT.
* [Advocating for the creation of a rigorous neuroscience curriculum](http://www.ricethresher.org/article/2017/11/fac-senate-neuroscience-major-vote){:target="_blank"} at Rice.
