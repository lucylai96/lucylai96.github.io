## hello, UCSD COGS! 
***
I'm super excited to be starting as an Assistant Teaching Professor in the Department of Cognitive Science at UCSD this coming Fall (2025)! If you're a current UCSD student who is interested in taking a course with me, you're in the right place :) 

As a college student, I remember feeling apprehensive about taking a course from a brand new professor---how would I know if they were any good at teaching? (Very fair question, as many professors show up on their first day without any teaching experience!). So now, as a new professor, I find it important to introduce myself and let you know what you can expect from me as an instructor and researcher. 

### who am I?
In case you didn't catch it on my home page, I got my Ph.D. in Neuroscience from Harvard in May 2024, where I worked on developing computational theories of learning and decision making. I've taught over 

### my teaching philosophy
If you're curious about all the details, you can read my entire teaching statement that I used when applying to this job!

## FAQs
#### Do you require attendence in your courses? 
- I don't require attendence in any of my courses, but I promise that attending class with me will almost always save you time when it comes to learning and remembering. I make an effort to make my classes as interactive as possible to promote active learning. Not only is this high-yield when it comes to learning, it also means that you don't need to figure out what's going on.

#### What will you be teaching? 

#### Are you going to be designing any new courses? 
- Yes! I love designing new courses
- 
#### Can I do research with you?
- For my first year at UCSD, I will be developing and teaching certain courses for the very first time, and I want to make sure they are well-prepped and high-quality. As a result, I will not be recruiting research assistants for the 2025-2026 academic year just yet (although, stay tuned in case that changes). I hope to start taking students
#### I am a PhD student, can you be my main supervisor?
- As a teaching-focused faculty member, my first priority is high-quality teaching for the department. However, I do maintain an active research agenda working on computational models of learning, decision making, belief change, and human-AI collaboration (please go here to read more about my research). While I will be focusing my first year solely on teaching, I will be open to taking PhD students in the future through the [UCSD Cognitive Science Ph.D. Program](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/graduates/phd-program/index.html). I am also able (and prefer) to co-advise Ph.D. students and sit on dissertation committees.

[TSVP Visiting Scholar](https://groups.oist.jp/tsvp){:target="_blank"} at the [Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology](https://oist.jp){:target="_blank"} in Japan. I'm broadly interested in computational theories of learning and decision making, belief formation and change, and disordered behavior in psychiatric disease. More recently, I've become interested in the collaboration between artificial and natural intelligence and how we can leverage AI while preserving human ingenuity and intellectual agency.

I completed my Ph.D. at Harvard with [Sam Gershman](http://gershmanlab.com/index.html){:target="_blank"}, where I studied decision making under cognitive resource constraints. My dissertation, _Policy compression: Acting with limited cognitive resources_, can be found <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/37378979" target="_blank">here</a>. A précis (summary) of my dissertation is <a href="https://lucylai.com/files/lai_precis.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

I completed my B.A. at Rice University, where I worked with [Jeff Yau](http://yaulab.com/){:target="_blank"} at [Baylor College of Medicine](http://www.bcm.edu/){:target="_blank"} on causal inference in multisensory perception. I've also worked with [Mehrdad Jazayeri](https://mcgovern.mit.edu/principal-investigators/mehrdad-jazayeri){:target="_blank"} at MIT, with [Josh Dudman](https://www.dudmanlab.org){:target="_blank"} at [Janelia Research Campus](https://www.janelia.org){:target="_blank"}, and with [Tobias Hauser](https://devcompsy.org/){:target="_blank"} and [Quentin Huys](https://acplab.org/){:target="_blank"} at the [Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry](https://www.mps-ucl-centre.mpg.de/){:target="_blank"}. The best part about science is truly all the wonderful people I have met along the way:-)
