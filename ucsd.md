## hello, UCSD COGS! 
***
I'm super excited to be starting as an Assistant Teaching Professor in the Department of Cognitive Science at UCSD this July 2025! If you're a current UCSD student wondering who I am and whether you should take a course with me, you're in the right place :) 

As a college student, I remember feeling apprehensive about taking a course from a brand new professor---how would I know if they were any good at teaching? (Very fair question, as some professors really do show up on their first day with 0 teaching experience ðŸ˜®) So as that new professor, I find it important to introduce myself and let you know what you can expect from me as an instructor.

### who am I?
In case you didn't catch it on my home page, I recieved my Ph.D. in Neuroscience from Harvard in May 2024, where I worked on developing computational theories of learning and decision making. Before that, I got my B.A. in Cognitive Science from Rice University---I'd like to think that this means I've been a true cognitive scientist from the beginning, which is why I'm so ecstatic to be starting my career at the [first cognitive science department in the world](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/about/dept-history.html)! 

As an Assistant Teaching Professor, I'm primarily responsible for developing and teaching high-quality courses that will give you a fundamental skill acros several subdomains of cognitive science. Specifically, my research and teaching background spans neuroscience, psychology, psychiatry, machine learning, and behavioral economics. I'm passionate about developing inclusive and innovative pedagogy, active learning in the classroom, and how we can best leverage AI to augment (but not replace) our learning experiences. 

As a researcher, I use ideas from machine learning to build models of human behavior. In the past, I've studied how limits on our cognitive resources influence our decision making behavior, and how the brain balances flexible behavior with automatized habits. At UCSD, I plan to expand my research agenda to study belief change and how beliefs lead to disordered behavior in psychiatric disease and the role of AI in belief change.  I've given talks around the globe, from the US to Singapore and Japan, and my work has been published in journals such as _PLOS Computational Biology_ and _Computational Psychiatry_. To learn more about my research, see my [publications here](https://lucylai.com/research.html).

### my teaching philosophy
I love teaching and I pour my heart and soul into it---it's the reason I pursued a teaching-focused career. I've been teaching in college classrooms for over 10 years (ever since I was a sophomore in undergrad). Over these years, I've had a chance to think critically about what it means to be a good teacher and mentor, what constitutes effective pedagogy, and what my personal values and beliefs are about higher education (in other words, what my teaching _philosophy_ is). Below, I summarize a few points that define my teaching philosophy:

- **Creating a structured learning experience** â€” I design my courses to be clear, well-organized, and fair so that you can focus on learning. Youâ€™ll always know whatâ€™s expected, when assignments are due, and when to expect feedback. I won't always be perfect 
- **I value rigor and intellectual agency** â€” I want you to leave my class not just knowing things, but knowing how to think critically, ask better questions, and drive your own learning.
- **Skill-based learning** â€” No matter the subject, Iâ€™ll connect the material to real-world problems and diverse perspectives.
- **Curiosity comes first** â€” I often start class with a puzzle or surprising question, and Iâ€™ll always encourage you to keep wondering and asking.
- **Class is active and collaborative** â€” Get ready to think, talk, write, and work with your peers. I believe we learn best by doing and discussing.
- **Feedback goes both ways** â€” Youâ€™ll get meaningful feedback on your work, and Iâ€™ll ask for your feedback to keep making the course better.
- **You belong here** â€” No matter your educational background, socioeconomic status, I want every student to feel welcome, heard, and supported in class, and I am committed to doing whatever I can to support your learning.
  
Often times, it's more useful to hear what I'm like as an instructor and teacher directly from my students.

## FAQs
#### Do you require attendence in your courses? 
- I don't require attendence in any of my courses, but I promise that attending class with me will almost always save you time when it comes to learning and remembering. I make an effort to make my classes as interactive as possible to promote active learning. Not only is this high-yield when it comes to learning, it also means that you don't need to figure out what's going on.

- 
#### What will you be teaching? 

#### Are you going to be designing any new courses? 
- Yes! I love designing new courses
- 
#### Can I do research with you?
- For my first year at UCSD, I will be developing and teaching certain courses for the very first time, and I want to make sure they are well-prepped and high-quality. As a result, I will not be recruiting research assistants for the 2025-2026 academic year just yet (although, stay tuned in case that changes). I hope to start taking students
#### I am a PhD student, can you be my main supervisor?
- As a teaching-focused faculty member, my first priority is high-quality teaching for the department. However, I do maintain an active research agenda working on computational models of learning, decision making, belief change, and human-AI collaboration (please go here to read more about my research). While I will be focusing my first year solely on teaching, I will be open to taking PhD students in the future through the [UCSD Cognitive Science Ph.D. Program](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/graduates/phd-program/index.html). I am also able (and prefer) to co-advise Ph.D. students and sit on dissertation committees.

[TSVP Visiting Scholar](https://groups.oist.jp/tsvp){:target="_blank"} at the [Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology](https://oist.jp){:target="_blank"} in Japan. I'm broadly interested in computational theories of learning and decision making, belief formation and change, and disordered behavior in psychiatric disease. More recently, I've become interested in the collaboration between artificial and natural intelligence and how we can leverage AI while preserving human ingenuity and intellectual agency.

I completed my Ph.D. at Harvard with [Sam Gershman](http://gershmanlab.com/index.html){:target="_blank"}, where I studied decision making under cognitive resource constraints. My dissertation, _Policy compression: Acting with limited cognitive resources_, can be found <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/37378979" target="_blank">here</a>. A prÃ©cis (summary) of my dissertation is <a href="https://lucylai.com/files/lai_precis.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

I completed my B.A. at Rice University, where I worked with [Jeff Yau](http://yaulab.com/){:target="_blank"} at [Baylor College of Medicine](http://www.bcm.edu/){:target="_blank"} on causal inference in multisensory perception. I've also worked with [Mehrdad Jazayeri](https://mcgovern.mit.edu/principal-investigators/mehrdad-jazayeri){:target="_blank"} at MIT, with [Josh Dudman](https://www.dudmanlab.org){:target="_blank"} at [Janelia Research Campus](https://www.janelia.org){:target="_blank"}, and with [Tobias Hauser](https://devcompsy.org/){:target="_blank"} and [Quentin Huys](https://acplab.org/){:target="_blank"} at the [Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry](https://www.mps-ucl-centre.mpg.de/){:target="_blank"}. The best part about science is truly all the wonderful people I have met along the way:-)
