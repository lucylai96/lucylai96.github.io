I'm super excited to be starting as an Assistant Teaching Professor in the [Department of Cognitive Science at UCSD](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/) this July 2025! If you're a current UCSD student wondering who I am and whether you should take a course with me, you're in the right place ðŸ˜Š As a college student, I remember feeling apprehensive about taking a course from a brand new professor---how would I know if they were any good at teaching? So as that new professor, I find it important to introduce myself and let you know what you can expect from me as an instructor.

### who am I?
In case you didn't catch it on my home page, I recieved my Ph.D. in Neuroscience from [Harvard](https://pinphd.hms.harvard.edu/) in May 2024, where I worked on [developing computational theories of learning and decision making](https://lucylai.com/files/lai_precis.pdf). Before that, I got my B.A. in Cognitive Science from [Rice University](https://cogsci.rice.edu/)---I'd like to think that this means I've been a true cognitive scientist from the beginning, which is why I'm ecstatic to be starting my career at the [first cognitive science department in the world](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/about/dept-history.html)! 

As an Assistant Teaching Professor, I'm primarily responsible for developing and teaching high-quality courses that will give you a fundamental skill set across several subdomains of cognitive science (see this [great FAQ on teaching professors](https://wstyler.ucsd.edu/teachingprof/)). Specifically, my [teaching background](https://lucylai.com/teaching.html) spans neuroscience, psychology, psychiatry, machine learning, and behavioral economics. I'm passionate about developing inclusive and innovative pedagogy, active learning in the classroom, and how we can best leverage AI to augment (but not replace) our learning experiences. To grow as an educator, I pursued a [Teaching Certificate from the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/teaching-certificate) and have also been trained in evidence-based, inclusive teaching practices via the [MAHPING Pedagogy Fellowship](https://mahping.hsites.harvard.edu/pedagogy-fellows-program). I have also won multiple teaching awards, including the _Harvard Certificate of Distinction in Teaching_ and _Rice Student-Taught Course Teaching Award_.

### my teaching philosophy
I love teaching and I pour my heart and soul into it---it's the reason I pursued a teaching-focused career. I've been teaching in college classrooms for over 10 years (ever since I was a sophomore in undergrad). Over these years, I've had a chance to think critically about what it means to be a good teacher and mentor, what constitutes effective pedagogy, and what my personal values and beliefs are about higher education (in other words, what my teaching _philosophy_ is). Below, I summarize a few points that define my teaching philosophy:

- **Creating a structured learning experience** â€” I design my courses to be well-organized and fair so that you can focus on learning. I strive to be clear in what you can expect of me, what is expected of you, when assignments are due, and when to expect feedback. 
- **I value rigor and intellectual agency** â€” I want you to leave my class not just knowing things, but knowing how to think critically, ask better questions, and drive your own learning.
- **Skill-based learning** â€” It's more important to me that you develop useful, domain-general skills in my courses than just memorizing facts for exams. No matter the subject, I strive to connect the material to real-world problems and practical skills such as critical thinking, meta-learning, collaboration, and distilling and communicating complex ideas.
- **Curiosity comes first** â€” Unfortunately, much of science is taught as memorization, but real scientists are motivated by puzzles and questions. I encourage you to keep asking questions.
- **Class is active and collaborative** â€” Get ready to think, talk, write, and work with your peers. I believe we learn best by learning together doing and discussing.
- **Feedback goes both ways** â€” Youâ€™ll get meaningful feedback on your work, and Iâ€™ll ask for your feedback to keep making the course better.
- **You belong here** â€” No matter your educational background, socioeconomic status, I want every student to feel welcome, heard, and supported in class, and I am committed to doing whatever I can to support your learning.
  
Often times, it's more useful to hear what I'm like as an instructor and teacher directly from my students. [This document](https://lucylai.com/files/ucsd/lai_teaching_excellence.pdf) summarizes my official course evaluations and comments received for every course I've taught or TA'ed.

If you're curious about all the details, you can read [my teaching statement](https://lucylai.com/files/ucsd/lai_teaching_statement.pdf) that describes this philosophy in detail (it's also the statement I submitted when applying to this job!)

## FAQs
   
#### What will you be teaching? 
In Fall 2025, I will be teaching COGS. In the future, I plan to also teach:
- COGS 180: Decision Making in the Brain
- COGS 182: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning
- COGS 118D: Computational Modeling of Behavior _(as a revamped course)_
  
_**I will update this page again once I receive my full teaching schedule for the 2025-2026 academic year.**_

#### Are you going to be designing any new courses? 
Yes! I love designing new courses and hope to share some of my expertise in the form of new courses. In particular, I am currently designing two new courses:

| **Course** | **Description** |
| **COGS 19: Living and learning with AI** | Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming the way we live, work, and learn. How can we leverage AIâ€™s potential while preserving human ingenuity and intellectual agency? This course equips students to critically engage with and creatively utilize AI through hands-on experimentation. Students will evaluate AIâ€™s capabilities and limitations, examine its impact on work, education, and creativity, and develop strategies for its responsible use. |
| **COGS 113: Cognitive Science of Belief** | Beliefs motivate our behaviors: they influence who we vote for, whether we take action against climate change, and what we think happens when we die. How do beliefs form, and how are they influenced by social and cognitive factors? Why do some beliefs persist despite conflicting evidence, while others change? This course explores the mechanisms of belief formation and change through experimental and theoretical perspectives. |

#### Do you require attendence? 
I don't require attendence in my courses, but I always strive to make class a worthwhile use of your time. I make an effort to make my classes as interactive as possible to promote active learning. Not only is this high-yield when it comes to learning, it also means that you don't need to spend time figuring out what's going on when you've missed class. At the same time, I recognize that flexibility is important when it comes to courses, so lectures will be recorded and podcasted when possible
 
#### Can I do research with you?
For my first year at UCSD, I will be developing and teaching many courses for the very first time, and I want to make sure they are well-prepped and high-quality. As a result, I will not be recruiting research assistants for the 2025-2026 academic year just yet (although, stay tuned in case that changes). I hope to start taking students

#### I am a PhD student, can you be my main supervisor?
As a teaching-focused faculty member, my first priority is high-quality teaching for the department. However, I do maintain an active research agenda working on computational models of learning, decision making, belief change, and human-AI collaboration (please go [here](https://lucylai.com/research.html) to read more about my research). While I will be focusing my first year solely on teaching, I am open to taking a very limited number of PhD students in the future through the [UCSD Cognitive Science Ph.D. Program](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/graduates/phd-program/index.html). I am also able (and prefer) to co-advise Ph.D. students and sit on dissertation committees.
