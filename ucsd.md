I’m super excited to be joining the [Department of Cognitive Science at UCSD](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/) as an **Assistant Teaching Professor** starting **July 2025!** If you’re a current UCSD student wondering who I am and whether you should take a course with me, you’re in the right place 😊 

As a student, I remember feeling hesitant about taking a course with a brand new professor--- _How would I know if they’re any good at teaching?_ So now that I’m the new professor, I want to introduce myself and let you know what you can expect from me as an instructor.

### who am I?
In case you missed it on my homepage, I earned my Ph.D. in Neuroscience from [Harvard](https://pinphd.hms.harvard.edu/) in 2024, where I worked on [developing computational theories of learning and decision making](https://lucylai.com/files/lai_precis.pdf). Before that, I got my B.A. in Cognitive Science from [Rice University](https://cogsci.rice.edu/)---I'd like to think that I've been a cognitive scientist from the start, which is why I'm ecstatic to be starting my career at the [first cognitive science department in the world](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/about/dept-history.html)! 

As an Assistant Teaching Professor[^1], my primary responsibility is to design and teach high-quality courses that will equip you with fundamental knowledge and skills across several subfields of cognitive science. My research and teaching background spans neuroscience, psychology, psychiatry, machine learning, and behavioral economics. I'm especially passionate about developing inclusive and innovative pedagogy, active learning in the classroom, and using AI to augment (but not replace!) our learning experiences. 

To grow as an educator, I pursued a Teaching Certificate from the [Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/teaching-certificate) and trained in evidence-based, inclusive teaching methods through the [MAHPING Pedagogy Fellowship](https://mahping.hsites.harvard.edu/pedagogy-fellows-program). I've also received several teaching awards, including the Harvard Certificate of Distinction in Teaching and the [Rice Student-Taught Course Teaching Award](https://cte.rice.edu/awards/stc-teaching-award)

### my teaching philosophy
I love teaching and I pour my heart and soul into it---it's the reason I pursued a teaching-focused career. I've been teaching in college classrooms for the last 10 years (ever since I was a sophomore in undergrad!), and have spent a lot of time thinking about what it means to be a good teacher, what effective learning looks like, and what I kind of classroom environment I want to build (in other words, what my teaching _philosophy_ is). Here's what you can expect if you take a course with me:

- **A structured learning experience** — I design my courses to be clear in their objectives, organized, and fair so that you can focus on learning and not logistics. I strive to be transparent in what's expected of you, when assignments are due, and when to expect feedback.
- **Rigor and intellectual agency** — I want you to leave my class not just knowing more facts, but knowing how to think critically, ask questions, and drive your own learning.
- **Curiosity comes first** —  Too often, science is taught like a list of facts to memorize. But real scientists are motivated by questions and puzzles! I aim to foster that spirit throughout the course, whether it's in lectures, assignments, or even exams.
- **Skill-based learning** — It's more important to me that you develop useful, domain-general skills in my courses over memorizing facts for exams. No matter the subject, I strive to connect class material to real-world problems and practical skills such as critical thinking, meta-learning, collaboration, and communicating complex ideas.
- **Class is active and collaborative** — Get ready to think, talk, write, and work with your peers. We often learn better when we learn together---through doing, discussing, and reflecting.
- **Feedback goes both ways** — You’ll receive meaningful feedback on your work, and I’ll ask for your feedback to keep improving the course.
- **You belong here** — No matter your background or identity, I want you to feel welcome, heard, and supported in class. I'm committed to doing whatever I can to help every student succeed and grow.
  
It’s one thing to hear about my teaching from me, but it's often more helpful to hear from my students themselves! [Here’s a summary of my official teaching evaluations and student comments](https://lucylai.com/files/ucsd/lai_teaching_excellence.pdf) from every course I've taught or TA'ed.

## FAQs
   
#### What will you be teaching? 
In Fall 2025, I will be teaching COGS. In the future, I plan to also teach:
- COGS 180: Decision Making in the Brain
- COGS 182: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning
- COGS 118D: Computational Modeling of Behavior _(as a revamped course)_
  
_**I will update this page again once I receive my full teaching schedule for the 2025-2026 academic year.**_

#### Are you going to be designing any new courses? 
Yes! I love designing new courses and hope to share some of my expertise in the form of new courses. In particular, I am currently designing two new courses:

|                 **Course**              | **Description** |
| **COGS 19: Living and learning with AI** | Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming the way we live, work, and learn. How can we leverage AI’s potential while preserving human ingenuity and intellectual agency? This course equips students to critically engage with and creatively utilize AI through hands-on experimentation. Students will evaluate AI’s capabilities and limitations, examine its impact on work, education, and creativity, and develop strategies for its responsible use. |
| **COGS 113: Cognitive Science of Belief** | Beliefs motivate our behaviors: they influence who we vote for, whether we take action against climate change, and what we think happens when we die. How do beliefs form, and how are they influenced by social and cognitive factors? Why do some beliefs persist despite conflicting evidence, while others change? This course explores the mechanisms of belief formation and change through experimental and theoretical perspectives. |

#### Do you require attendence? 
I don't require attendence in my courses, but I always strive to make class a worthwhile use of your time. I make an effort to make my classes as interactive as possible to promote active learning. Not only is this high-yield when it comes to learning, it also means that you don't need to spend time figuring out what's going on when you've missed class. At the same time, I recognize that flexibility is important when it comes to courses, so lectures will be recorded and podcasted when possible
 
#### Can I do research with you?
For my first year at UCSD, I will be developing and teaching many courses for the very first time, and I want to make sure they are well-prepped and high-quality. As a result, I will not be recruiting research assistants for the 2025-2026 academic year just yet (although, stay tuned in case that changes). I hope to start taking students

#### I am a PhD student, can you be my main supervisor?
As a teaching-focused faculty member, my first priority is high-quality teaching for the department. However, I do maintain an active research agenda working on computational models of learning, decision making, belief change, and human-AI collaboration (please go [here](https://lucylai.com/research.html) to read more about my research). While I will be focusing my first year solely on teaching, I am open to taking a very limited number of PhD students in the future through the [UCSD Cognitive Science Ph.D. Program](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/graduates/phd-program/index.html). I am also able (and prefer) to co-advise Ph.D. students and sit on dissertation committees.
