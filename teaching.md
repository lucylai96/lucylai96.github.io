Teaching is one of my greatest joys :-)

### currently

I am currently a Teaching Fellow for a (Spring '21)

#### NB314QC / NB212: Math Tools for Neuroscience
[Alex Chen](https://twitter.com/alexbchen) and I designed and taught a new January-term course for the Harvard Program in Neuroscience. We condensed the fundamentals of linear algebra, dynamical systems theory, and probability theory (as applied to neuroscience) into a one-month crash course.

All course materials (including the syllabus, lecture notes, and problem sets) are publicly available on [our course Canvas site](https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/71556).

_Update (Sept 2020):_ Math Tools has been converted into a full-semester course and was added as a foundational requirement for the PiN [Certificate in Computational Neuroscience](https://www.hms.harvard.edu/dms/neuroscience/curriculum/certificate.html). Much thanks to [Ella Batty](https://ebatty.github.io/) for helping push this effort :-) A complete syllabus, YouTube video lectures, and Google Colab notebook assignments are freely available [here](https://github.com/ebatty/MathToolsforNeuroscience). Much of this course was modeled after the amazing [Neuromatch Academy online computational neuroscience course](https://www.neuromatchacademy.org/syllabus).

### previously
At Rice, I was a teaching assistant for:

* Cognitive Neuroscience _(Spring ’16, ’17, ’18)_
* Neural Computation _(Spring ’18)_
* Fundamentals of Neuroscience _(Fall ’16, ’17)_
* Probability and Statistics _(Fall ‘16)_
* Intro to Cognitive Psychology _(Fall ’15)_

Before I left the Yau Lab, I gave a little tutorial on [model building and fitting](./files/lai_modeling.pdf).

I was also a mentor at [BrainSTEM](https://tmcbrainstem.org/), an after-school neuroscience program at [KIPP Sunnyside High School](http://kipphouston.org/sunnyside). The program serves to promote interest in STEM and neuroscience in underserved areas of Houston.

#### COLL 158: How Music Plays The Brain

By far, my favorite teaching endeavor has been bringing [COLL 158: How Music Plays the Brain](https://courses.rice.edu/admweb/!SWKSCAT.cat?p_action=CATALIST&p_acyr_code=2019&p_crse_numb=158&p_subj=COLL) to life! I designed and taught 3 semesters of this seminar course on the intersection of music and neuroscience. _COLL 158 won the 2017 Rice University [Student-Taught Course Teaching award](https://cte.rice.edu/stc#award)!_

All course materials (including the syllabus and lecture slides) from the last rendition of the course (Spring 2018) are publicly available on [the course Canvas site](https://canvas.rice.edu/courses/10423/).

_**COLL 158 visits Baylor College of Medicine's [Core for Advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging](https://www.bcm.edu/research/centers/advanced-mr-imaging) (CAMRI)**_

> “Students will leave this course having developed a greater appreciation for the power of music through dialogues between an age-old art and a budding field of science.”  - from the syllabus

Did I fulfill my promises? :-)
