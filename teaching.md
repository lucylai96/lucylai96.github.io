Teaching is one of my greatest joys. 

### currently...
Along with my classmate and friend, [Alex Chen](https://twitter.com/alexbchen), I designed **NB314QC: Math Tools for Neuroscience**--a new January-term course for the Harvard Program in Neuroscience.

All course materials (including the syllabus and problem sets) are publically availible on [our course Canvas site](https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/71556).

### previously...
At Rice, I was a teaching assistant for:

* **NEUR/PSYC362:** Cognitive Neuroscience _(Spring ’16, ’17, ’18)_
* **NEUR/CAAM416:** Neural Computation _(Spring ’18)_ 
  * I contributed [a lecture](./bci_lecture.pdf) on Bayesian Causal Inference in perception.
* **NEUR/BIOC385:** Fundamentals of Neuroscience _(Fall ’16, ’17)_
* **STAT310:** Probability and Statistics _(Fall ‘16)_
* **PSYC203:** Intro to Cognitive Psychology _(Fall ’15)_

Before I left the Yau Lab, I gave a little tutorial on [model building and fitting](./lai_modeling.pdf).

I was also a mentor at [BrainSTEM](https://brainstem.club/), an after-school neuroscience program at [KIPP Sunnyside High School](http://kipphouston.org/sunnyside). The program serves to promote interest in STEM and neuroscience to underrepresented minorities.

#### COLL 158: How Music Plays The Brain

By far, my favorite teaching endeavor has been bringing [COLL 158: “How Music Plays the Brain.”](https://courses.rice.edu/admweb/!SWKSCAT.cat?p_action=CATALIST&p_acyr_code=2019&p_crse_numb=158&p_subj=COLL) to life: I designed and taught 3 semesters of this seminar course on the intersection of music and neuroscience.

> “Students will leave this course having developed a greater appreciation for the power of music through dialogues between an age-old art and a budding field of science.” -– lofty goals from the [course syllabus](https://docs.google.com/a/rice.edu/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSEOAOsSzzJJTJuK-n5mIAhbJBXXJzCk7ZmlUppfPqA8NLAj1-PjvgmIYkqssITnNSIoEm8tnf41r3s/pub)

So, did I fulfill my promises? :p
