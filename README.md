I am an incoming Ph.D. student in the [Harvard Program in Neuroscience](http://www.hms.harvard.edu/dms/neuroscience/index.html). Previously, I studied Cognitive Science, Neuroscience, and Computational and Applied Mathematics at Rice University. Iâ€™m interested in multisensory perception, sensorimotor integration, and Bayesian models of behavior. Besides research, I enjoy teaching, playing the piano, running, poetry, and classical music.

You can email me at lucylai (at) g (dot) harvard (dot) edu.
