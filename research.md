> "All animals suffer unhappiness because learning is design, and this particular design for learning is optimal..."  - from Principles of Neural Design (Sterling and Laughlin)

### currently
I completed my Ph.D. in the [Computational Cognitive Neuroscience Lab](http://gershmanlab.com/index.html){:target="_blank"} in May 2024, where I worked on computational theories of learning and decision making under cognitive resource constraints. Iâ€™m curious about how cognitive constraints can both benefit and limit our behavioral repertoire, and how the trade-off between reward and cognitive effort is compromised in psychiatric disease. I am also interested more broadly in the limitations of human reasoning and thought, and in the collaboration between artificial and natural intelligence. My thesis, _Policy compression: Acting with limited cognitive resources_, can be found <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/37378979" target="_blank">here</a>.

From September 2023 until June 2025, I am a [TSVP Visiting Scholar](https://groups.oist.jp/tsvp){:target="_blank"} with [Gail Tripp](https://groups.oist.jp/hdnu){:target="_blank"} and [Kenji Doya](https://groups.oist.jp/ncu){:target="_blank"} at the beautiful [Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology](https://oist.jp){:target="_blank"}.

### previously
My undergraduate research days were spent in the [Yau Lab](http://yaulab.com/){:target="_blank"} at [Baylor College of Medicine](http://www.bcm.edu/){:target="_blank"}. There I worked on developing a Bayesian inference model for understanding multisensory time distortions.

I often fled north to escape hot Houston summers... :-)

Thanks to an [NSF-REU](http://csne-erc.org/content/research-experience-undergraduates){:target="_blank"}, I spent some time at [MIT](http://www.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"} working in the lab of [Mehrdad Jazayeri](https://mcgovern.mit.edu/principal-investigators/mehrdad-jazayeri){:target="_blank"}. My work there focused on understanding how variability in perception, inference, and memory influences sensorimotor timing.

I spent another summer at the beautiful [Janelia Research Campus](https://www.janelia.org){:target="_blank"} as a part of the [JUS program](https://www.janelia.org/you-janelia/students-postdocs/undergraduate-scholars-program){:target="_blank"}. There, [Josh Dudman](https://www.dudmanlab.org){:target="_blank"} taught me to [record from neurons](./files/neurons), and together we tried to understand how the striatum might represent action kinematics.
