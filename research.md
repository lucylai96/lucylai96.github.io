***
I am currently a [TSVP Visiting Scholar](https://groups.oist.jp/tsvp){:target="_blank"} at the [Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology](https://oist.jp){:target="_blank"} in Japan.

I completed my Ph.D. at Harvard with [Sam Gershman](http://gershmanlab.com/index.html){:target="_blank"}, where I worked on computational theories of learning and decision making under cognitive resource constraints. My dissertation, _Policy compression: Acting with limited cognitive resources_, can be found <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/37378979" target="_blank">here</a>. A pr√©cis of my work is <a href="https://lucylai.com/files/lai_precis.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

I completed my B.A. at Rice University, where I worked with [Jeff Yau](http://yaulab.com/){:target="_blank"} at [Baylor College of Medicine](http://www.bcm.edu/){:target="_blank"} on causal inference in multisensory perception. I've also spent time at MIT with [Mehrdad Jazayeri](https://mcgovern.mit.edu/principal-investigators/mehrdad-jazayeri){:target="_blank"}, at [Janelia Research Campus](https://www.janelia.org){:target="_blank"} with [Josh Dudman](https://www.dudmanlab.org){:target="_blank"}, and at the [Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry](https://www.mps-ucl-centre.mpg.de/){:target="_blank"} with [Tobias Hauser](https://devcompsy.org/){:target="_blank"} and [Quentin Huys](https://acplab.org/){:target="_blank"}. The best part about science is truly all the wonderful people I get to work with :-)
