> "All animals suffer unhappiness because learning is design, and this particular design for learning is optimal..."  - from Principles of Neural Design (Sterling and Laughlin)

### currently
I am a grad student in the [Computational Cognitive Neuroscience Lab](http://gershmanlab.com/index.html){:target="_blank"}, working on theories of learning under computational resource constraints. Iâ€™m curious about how these constraints can both benefit and limit our behavioral repertoire, and how the trade-off between reward and cognitive cost is compromised in psychiatric disease. I am also interested more broadly in the limitations of human reasoning and thought, and in the collaboration between artificial and natural intelligence.

### previously
My undergraduate research days were spent in the [Yau Lab](http://yaulab.com/){:target="_blank"} at [Baylor College of Medicine](http://www.bcm.edu/){:target="_blank"}. There I worked on developing a Bayesian inference model for understanding multisensory time distortions.

I often fled north to escape hot Houston summers... :-)

Thanks to an [NSF-REU](http://csne-erc.org/content/research-experience-undergraduates){:target="_blank"}, I spent some time at [MIT](http://www.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"} working in the lab of [Mehrdad Jazayeri](https://mcgovern.mit.edu/principal-investigators/mehrdad-jazayeri){:target="_blank"}. My work there focused on understanding how variability in perception, inference, and memory influences sensorimotor timing.

I spent another summer at the beautiful [Janelia Research Campus](https://www.janelia.org){:target="_blank"} as a part of the [JUS program](https://www.janelia.org/you-janelia/students-postdocs/undergraduate-scholars-program){:target="_blank"}. There, [Josh Dudman](https://www.dudmanlab.org){:target="_blank"} taught me to [record from neurons](./files/neurons), and together we tried to understand how the striatum might represent action kinematics.
