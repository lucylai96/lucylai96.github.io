#### Are you going to be designing any new courses? 
Yes! I'm currently in the process of designing two new COGS courses: 

|                 **Course**              | **Description** |
| **COGS 19: Living and Learning with AI** | Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming the way we live, work, and learn. How can we leverage AI’s potential while preserving human ingenuity and intellectual agency? This course equips students to critically engage with and creatively utilize AI through hands-on experimentation. Students will evaluate AI’s capabilities and limitations, examine its impact on work, education, and creativity, and develop strategies for its responsible use. |
| **COGS 113: Cognitive Science of Belief** | Beliefs motivate our behaviors: they influence who we vote for, whether we take action against climate change, and what we think happens when we die. How do beliefs form, and how are they influenced by social and cognitive factors? Why do some beliefs persist despite conflicting evidence, while others change? This course explores the mechanisms of belief formation and change through experimental and theoretical perspectives. |

I expect these courses to be offered for the first time starting in the 2026-2027 academic year.

#### Do you require attendence? 
I don't require lecture attendence in my courses (it's often extra credit), but I strive to make class a valuable use of your time. I put effort into designing interactive, engaging lectures that promote **active learning** (there is a plethora of [scientific evidence](https://citl.indiana.edu/teaching-resources/evidence-based/active-learning.html) showing how this approach is more effective for retaining and understanding material). Attending lecture will help you stay on top of the course and reduce the need to play catch-up later. That said, I also value flexibility, so all lectures will be recorded and podcasted!
 
#### Can I do research with you?
Not just yet---but hopefully soon! During my first year at UCSD, I’ll be focused on developing and teaching several courses for the first time, and I want to make sure they are well-prepped and high-quality. As a result, **I will not be recruiting research assistants for the 2025–2026 academic year** (but stay tuned in case that changes!).

#### I am a PhD student, can you be my main supervisor?
As a teaching-focused faculty member, my first priority is providing high-quality undergraduate instruction. That said, I do maintain an active research agenda working on computational models of learning, decision making, and belief change (you can read more about my research [here](https://lucylai.com/research.html)). While I will be focusing my first year at UCSD on teaching, I'm open to advising or co-advising a very limited number of Ph.D. students in the future through the [Cognitive Science Ph.D. Program](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/graduates/phd-program/index.html). I’m also happy to serve on dissertation committees where there’s a good research fit.
