## opportunities 🤝🏻
***
On this page, I'll post any current open oppourtunities to work with me as a TA, PLA (formerly IA), or RA (research assistants).

### peer learning assistants (PLAs) 
Whether you end up in academia or industry, you will likely encounter opportunities to teach, mentor, or support others. The PLA role a structured way to practice these skills. Under my guidance, you will gain hands-on experience in evidence-based pedagogy, course facilitation, and academic mentorship by helping shape an effective learning environment for one of my courses. You will also deepen your understanding of the course material (the best way to learn is to teach!), strengthen your communication and leadership skills, and see firsthand how courses are intentionally designed and taught with students in mind. 

**Basic requirements** (see the [official COGS PLA site](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/undergraduates/student-resources/ia.html){:target="_blank"} for more info)**:**
* Upper-division standing (90+ units completed)
* GPA > 3.0
* Earned **at least an A-** in the course
* Can only serve as a PLA for **one course per quarter**
* **Cannot** serve as a PLA for the **same course twice**
* **Cannot** be a PLA **more than twice** in your entire academic career
* **Instructor approval** (see #2 below)

**NOTE: PLA applications in COGS are now course-based and require my approval.** If you’d like to be considered for a PLA position, please do the following:
1. Read this [PLA "syllabus"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15gANVvomvQle8RsERJd59eQBw42BnHl-q4xsdVKCUc4/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} in its entirety to get a sense of the general role and responsibilities (may vary depending on the course you are PLAing for).
3. Fill out [my PLA application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSept59lwQhmjiuiqTEeHwgudheXXVRg6NShJYThDWoa9Kbjjg/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=113612539407126073694){:target="_blank"} anytime before the end of **Week 7** in the quarter prior (**Nov 14th** for Wi26 & **Feb 20** for Sp26). Note: This is the "instructor approval" step, and is different from the COGS PLA application.
4. You will hear from me **by the end of the quarter**. If offered a PLA position, you will be contacted by the COGS advising team to **enroll in COGS 195P** (you'll recieve a 4-unit course credit for being a PLA). If you are not offered a position, you may still have the opportunity to work as a paid reader (grader) for the course (though you will be less involved in the course itself).

### teaching assistants (TAs) 
If you are interested in being a TA for [one of the courses that I teach](https://lucylai.com/teaching.html){:target="_blank"}, please do the following:
1. Send me an email with **brief** answers to the following: 
  - Tell me a little about yourself and your academic background
  - Which course and quarter are you interested in TA-ing and why that particular course(s)?
  - Do you have any prior teaching experience? If so, briefly describe your role and responsibilities.
2. Please apply through the [official TA application](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/graduates/teaching-assistants/index.html){:target="_blank"}, which opens several weeks before the start of each quarter.

Please note that priority is always given to **COGS grad students** and excellent TAs who have worked with me in the past. 

### research assistants (RAs)
I am not recruiting research assistants at the moment (but stay tuned in case that changes!).
