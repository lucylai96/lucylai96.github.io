### Friendship (Library Room)
Here‚Äôs the story of how we met‚Ä¶
Ethan & Lucy first at Rice University on August 16, 2014, where they first laid eyes on each other in freshman poetry class. 

#### Exhibit A
**FWIS 185: Contemporary American Poetry** is where Ethan was first introduced and drawn to the depth of Lucy‚Äôs heart & mind. See the bookmarks in our class poem booklet to find several poems that Ethan and Lucy wrote! 

#### Exhibit B
Some (very early) college memories...learning to ‚Äúadult‚Äù as college kids, going to campus events, and taking the Sunday bus to church :) 

#### Exhibit C
**Cornerstone Christian Fellowship** is where Ethan & Lucy were first able to observe each other‚Äôs relationship with God. Ethan still remembers the first time he heard Lucy‚Äôs life story, and was struck by how she grew in faith through life‚Äôs hardships. And although Lucy was not yet attracted to Ethan, she knew he was ‚Äúsolid‚Äù in how consistently he pursued God and discipled other guys. 

#### Exhibit D
**Ethan and other Rice friends support Lucy‚Äôs fundraiser for the Lupus 5K.** This is where Lucy. Here, Ethan learned of Lucy‚Äôs passion for making a difference.


#### Exhibit E
**Ethan takes Lucy‚Äôs class ‚ÄúHow Music Plays the Brain."** One of Ethan‚Äôs first steps toward increasing Lucy‚Äôs exposure to him after she became single again. We‚Äôll never know if this actually helped Lucy eventually fall for him üòâ

#### Exhibit F

One afternoon, Ethan & Lucy had fun recording songs together. Tune in to our rendition of our favorite worship song ‚ÄúThis Is Living.‚Äù These recording sessions allowed Ethan to seduce Lucy with his amazing singing voice, and also showed her how even though he was a better singer, he was willing to let her take the spotlight and be the supporting harmony instead of the solo‚Ä¶

#### Exhibit F
Senior year | Lucy becomes single | Ethan asks her out | Rejection #1
April 26, 2018: Ethan makes a ~romantic~ dinner for Lucy (one week before he asked her out). Here you can read the graduation letter that Ethan wrote to Lucy -- and see how he hinted at romance. 

#### *Lucy and ethan graduate from Rice and begin their journey anew at Harvard*
This is the story of how we met‚Ä¶again! We somehow both ended up at Harvard, still just friends. In August 2018, Ethan begins dental school and Lucy starts her PhD in neuroscience.

#### Exhibit G
**A Prophecy over dim sum:** Shortly after they both moved to Boston, Lucy invited Ethan to have dim sum with her family at the Windsor Cafe in Chinatown (like come on, Lucy, how could you invite the guy who just rejected?!). After the meal, the Lai family and Ethan went for a walk in Boston commons; there, a prophetic moment occurred. They were walking past some pigeons, when Ethan interestingly told Lucy‚Äôs mom the random fact that birds are monogamous. In that moment, Lucy‚Äôs mom was struck by a prophetic vision of Ethan & Lucy ending up together someday. From that day forward, Lucy‚Äôs mom prayed for Ethan & Lucy‚Äîand kept it a secret until they actually got engaged...FOUR YEARS LATER.

Here is the photo Lucy‚Äôs mom snuck of Lucy & Ethan looking at the monogamous pigeons. Little did they know, it was indeed a prophetic vision of their future.


#### Exhibit H
**Sweet memories Ethan & Lucy‚Äôs friendship in Boston.** It‚Äôs funny to see in retrospect how ‚Äúdate-y‚Äù their hangouts had always been...Notice Lucy‚Äôs hand position in the photo of them on Ethan‚Äôs D1 boat cruise. What about Ethan‚Äôs hand-drawn birthday card to Lucy? Ah, what a romantic.
