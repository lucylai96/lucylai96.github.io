### Friendship (Library Room)
Ethan & Lucy first met at Rice University on Monday, August 18, 2014 in a freshman year poetry class. This room tells the story of their first 6.5 years of friendship.

#### Exhibit A
**FWIS 185: Contemporary American Poetry** is where Ethan was first introduced and drawn to the depth of Lucy‚Äôs heart & mind. See the bookmarks in our class poem booklet to find several poems that Ethan and Lucy wrote! 

#### Exhibit B
**Some (very early) college memories...** learning to ‚Äúadult‚Äù as college kids, going to campus events, and taking the Sunday bus to church :) 

#### Exhibit C
**Cornerstone Christian Fellowship** is where Ethan & Lucy were first able to observe each other‚Äôs relationship with God. Ethan still remembers the first time he heard Lucy‚Äôs life story, and was struck by how she grew in faith through life‚Äôs hardships. And although Lucy was not yet attracted to Ethan, she knew he was ‚Äúsolid‚Äù in how consistently he pursued God and discipled other guys. 

#### Exhibit D
**Ethan and other Rice friends support Lucy‚Äôs fundraiser for the Lupus 5K.** Here, Ethan learned of Lucy‚Äôs passion for gathering community together to make a difference.

#### Exhibit E
**Ethan takes Lucy‚Äôs class ‚ÄúHow Music Plays the Brain."** This was one of Ethan‚Äôs first steps toward increasing Lucy‚Äôs exposure to him after she became single again. We‚Äôll never know if this actually helped Lucy eventually fall for him üòâ

#### Exhibit F
**A dinner together before graduation.** On April 26, 2018, Ethan makes a romantic dinner for Lucy (one week before he asked her out for the first time). Here you can read the graduation letter that Ethan wrote to Lucy--and see how he hinted at romance. 

#### Exhibit G
**One afternoon, Ethan & Lucy had fun recording songs together.** Tune in to our rendition of our favorite worship song ‚ÄúThis Is Living.‚Äù These recording sessions allowed Ethan to seduce Lucy with his amazing singing voice. Even though he was a better singer, Ethan was willing to let Lucy take the spotlight and be the supporting harmony instead of the solo...She took note.

#### Exhibit H
**Lucy and Ethan graduate from Rice and begin their journey anew at Harvard** Then we met...again! We somehow both ended up at Harvard, still just friends. In August 2018, Ethan begins dental school and Lucy starts her PhD in neuroscience. Lucy supports Ethan at his white coat ceremony.

#### Exhibit I
**A prophecy over dim sum.** Shortly after they both moved to Boston, Lucy invited Ethan to have dim sum with her family at the Windsor Cafe in Chinatown (like come on, Lucy, how could you invite the guy you just rejected?!) After the meal, Ethan and the Lai family went for a walk in Boston Common; there, a prophetic moment occurred. They were walking past some pigeons, when Ethan interestingly told Lucy‚Äôs mom the random fact that birds are monogamous. Lucy‚Äôs mom was struck by that statement and had a sudden vision of Ethan & Lucy ending up together someday. From that day forward, Lucy‚Äôs mom prayed for Ethan & Lucy‚Äî-and kept it a secret until they actually got engaged...**FOUR YEARS LATER.**

Here is the photo Lucy‚Äôs mom snuck of Lucy & Ethan looking at the monogamous pigeons. Little did they know, it was indeed a prophetic vision of their future.

#### Exhibit J
**Sweet memories Ethan & Lucy‚Äôs friendship in Boston.** It‚Äôs funny to see in retrospect how ‚Äúdate-y‚Äù their hangouts had always been...Notice Lucy‚Äôs hand position in the photo of them on Ethan‚Äôs D1 boat cruise. And when Lucy invited Ethan to run the Cambridge Half Marathon with her (and 20 other friends). What about Ethan‚Äôs hand-drawn birthday card to Lucy? Ah, what a romantic.

#### Exhibit K
**May 14, 2019, Ethan spontaneously asks Lucy to bike to Middlesex Fells Reservation.** Lucy thought they were going to die when Ethan led them onto a highway with a lot of fast cars. But at the same time, she enjoyed the thrill and caught a glimpse of Ethan's adventurous side. As Lucy biked behind Ethan, a thought crossed her mind--she wondered what it‚Äôd be like to join Ethan in the thrilling adventure of life. At Middlesex Fells, they had a pseudo-picnic date.

#### Exhibit L
**Lucy buys Ethan birthday tickets to see Daniel Caesar.** Ethan once again wondered what Lucy‚Äôs intentions were, looking this hot and taking him out to a concert. Daniel Caesar‚Äôs ‚ÄúBest Part‚Äù now has a special place in their relationship. 

#### Exhibit M
**A birthday hiking trip to the White Mountains** in September 2020 is what finally changed Lucy‚Äôs mind about Ethan. She realized how much she missed their conversations and kept sheepishly asking Nicky and Aaron (her two other guys friends on the trip): ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt think I would be good together with Ethan right? RIGHT??‚Äù

### Dating (The Den)
**On October 22, 2020,** Lucy ran 3.5 miles in the house in cold, drizzling rain, to deliver a 6-page handwritten letter confessing her feelings to Ethan. A few days later, on October 26, 2020 they officially started dating! 

#### Exhibit A
**Ethan and Lucy‚Äôs first ‚Äúreal date‚Äù** was a wintery walk through Jamaica Pond and breakfast at at diner near Middlesex Fells reservation! They reflected on all their "friend" interactions and Lucy admitted that she had ignored the "vibes" all along. 

#### Exhibit B
Ethan and Lucy take their first trip out to Western Massachusetts together (Williamstown) with friends Michael and Aurore. Ethan tries to teach Lucy to snowboard and realizes he needs to grow in patience (she wasn't very good...)

#### Exhibit C
**"The Dentist"** is a poem that Lucy wrote in December 2020 while sitting in a dental chair waiting for a cleaning. Ethan was obsessed. See if you can analyze the deeper meanings of the poem :)

#### Exhibit D
**Visiting Rice as a couple.** Ethan and Lucy return to Houston, where their friendship began. They re-visited Baker and Lovett Colleges, their respective residential living communities at Rice (which neighbor each other), and wandered back to their poetry classroom where they first met. They reflected on their first impressions of each other, and laughed at how things have changed.

#### Exhibit E
**Meeting each other's families.** Five months into dating, Ethan visited Lucy's family home in Houston, Texas for the first time. A couple months later, Lucy visited Ethan's home in Portland, Oregon. They laughed at the similarites they saw in their respective families and upbringing. Both of them appreciate how much work their immigrant parents put into raising them--Mom and Dad, we love you! Today, they become a new family and new home to each other...

#### Exhibit F
**Ethan matches to residency.** In December of 2021, Ethan matched to Great Lakes Naval Station in North Chicago. As a part of a Navy scholarship, Ethan got to attend Harvard School of Dental Medicine for free, but as a result he has to serve in the Navy as a Dental Officer for the next four years. Lucy never in a million years thought she'd become a "military wife," but this is yet another one of those instances where Lucy and Ethan had to learn to trust God with their futures, including where the military decides to send them...

#### Exhibit G
**Various dates throughout the years.** As they grew in their dating relationship, Ethan and Lucy got to know each other in a new light. All the tensions they felt in frienship suddenly melted away, and their transition to romance was surprisingly natural (in contrast to what Lucy feared about turning a friend into a lover). It wasn‚Äôt always easy, however. Lucy struggled to heal from her previous relationship, and Ethan struggled in learning how to love Lucy in the way she needed and being patient with her healing process. They had many conversations about their hopes and dreams in life. They discussed whether they could align their futures and create a life together. Through lots of prayer and discernment, they decided that they were going to make it work!


### Engaged (The Cabin Room)
Buckle up for a story, kids!

#### Exhibit A
**How did Ethan propose?**
*Ethan*: When Lucy finally signaled to me that she was ready to be engaged, we only had 2 weeks left together in Boston before I left for Naval Officer School and Lucy left to London for the summer. Since surprise was my number priority, I knew it was stupid to propose in those 2 weeks. But I also didn‚Äôt have any military leave yet...I decided I was going to ask the US government for permission to go to London...in the middle of officer training. With that dream in mind, I began to make the plan.

Phase 1 involved setting up the surprise in London. It was extremely difficult to plan, because I had no idea when and if the Navy would let me go, and Lucy was constantly traveling throughout Europe. So I just had to randomly pick some dates and hope that Lucy was in London. I googled the email of the professor Lucy was working with in London, emailed him and he replied! (You can read the actual emails here!)

He and I devised a plan to invite Lucy to a fake soir√©e to which when she showed up to, I would be waiting for her.

In officer school, I found time to ask for permission to go to London. Two weeks before the anticipated date, I had finally "earned" 48 hours of military leave and obtained permission to travel internationally. Fast forward to July 23, my flight to London was scheduled for 11 PM. I prayed for no delays and fortunately everything looked OK when I was the first one to board my plane at 10 PM. I quickly fell asleep, but to my horror when I awoke at midnight, the plane was still on the ground and had headed back to our gate. 

It turned out that the plan was having mechanical issues and could not take off! Desperately, I asked to get off the plane to see if there were any other flights I could take. "I have 48 hours to go to London to propose to my girlfriend!!!" They let me off and I proceeded to run around the airport seeing what was available...It turned out there was one other plane flying to London at 4AM, so I ran to that gate. Unfortunately, the plane was full and there were now 2 plane-loads worth of people trying to fly on one plane. 

I got on the waiting list, but they told me not to have my hopes up. The plane started boarding and I started begging people in line to let me buy their ticket off of them, but nobody said yes. The last person boarded and the gatekeeper closed the doors..that was when I knew I had to send it, so I ducked into the ropes, went up to the gatekeeper and asked him if he could go back onto the plane and see if they were any empty seats. By some miracle (!!) he obliged and ran into the plane (this is against the law, as we learned). A few minutes later, he emerge from the plane and said there was ONE (1!!) empty seat left. I was still 15th on the waiting list but because he knew I was active duty military, he gave me the very last seat. 

When I finally arrived in London, the plan was executed beautifully (thank you Jesus!). With the help of friends in London, Josh Talbot (here at the wedding!) brought me from the airport to Lucy's friend Jilly's house to quickly change and shower. I then went to a bougie wine bar where the surprise was set to be at. The waitresses seated me at a table with a bottle of wine, and I waited for Lucy to arrive for the "soir√©e." 

I‚Äôll never forget her look of shock and the way her jaw dropped the moment she saw me, in disbelief that I was there in London. We shared a glass of wine, and from there, Josh chauffeured us to Primrose Hill, a park overlooking the London skyline. As we walked up the hill, three friends handed Lucy three sets of letters I had written: one representing the past (friendship), one representing the present (dating), and one representing the future (marriage). When we got to the top of the hill, a picnic blanket and photographer were waiting for us. I took a knee told Lucy: "Here ends my previous existence. Take it: it led me to you. Lucy Lai, will you marry me?"

*Lucy*: I truly had no idea and was so surprised. I am convinced that I married the most romantic man alive! I am so lucky.

#### Exhibit B
**The proposal captured on camera!** We had a lovely dinner at Bob Bob Ricard in London's SoHo district the next day. That was probably the most expensive meal we'd ever had!

#### Exhibit C
**Even after he got the girl, Ethan still spoils Lucy.** Ethan planned a lovely Fall getaway in Wisconsin for Lucy's birthday. Ethan and Andrew (his best man) made her an incredible meal and even a birthday itinerary!

#### Exhibit D
**A year of long distance.** Despite the distance, with Ethan living in Chicago for his Navy dental residency and Lucy still living in Boston, they made the time and effort to visit each other, meet new friends, and throw fun parties! Being engaged meant that there was something to look forward to!

### Married (The Cabin Room)
We are so excited to start married life together in **Okinawa, Japan**! Here, we wanted to share with you our vision for our marriage through an analysis of who we are as individuals and then together as a couple. It is our hope and prayer that we grow to become vessels of God's Love and Rest to others, even as we ourselves continue to grow, individually and together.

We hoped you enjoyed our Love Museum and learned something new about our relationship today! Thank you again for spending this day to celebrate us together. We love each and every one of you!
