### Friendship (Library Room)
Ethan & Lucy first met at Rice University on Monday, August 18, 2014 in a freshman year poetry class. This room tells the story of their first 6.5 years of friendship.

#### Exhibit A
**FWIS 185: Contemporary American Poetry** is where Ethan was first introduced and drawn to the depth of Lucy‚Äôs heart & mind. See the bookmarks in our class poem booklet to find several poems that Ethan and Lucy wrote! 

#### Exhibit B
**Some (very early) college memories...** learning to ‚Äúadult‚Äù as college kids, going to campus events, and taking the Sunday bus to church :) 

#### Exhibit C
**Cornerstone Christian Fellowship** is where Ethan & Lucy were first able to observe each other‚Äôs relationship with God. Ethan still remembers the first time he heard Lucy‚Äôs life story, and was struck by how she grew in faith through life‚Äôs hardships. And although Lucy was not yet attracted to Ethan, she knew he was ‚Äúsolid‚Äù in how consistently he pursued God and discipled other guys. 

#### Exhibit D
**Ethan and other Rice friends support Lucy‚Äôs fundraiser for the Lupus 5K.** Here, Ethan learned of Lucy‚Äôs passion for gathering community together to make a difference.

#### Exhibit E
**Ethan takes Lucy‚Äôs class ‚ÄúHow Music Plays the Brain."** This was one of Ethan‚Äôs first steps toward increasing Lucy‚Äôs exposure to him after she became single again. We‚Äôll never know if this actually helped Lucy eventually fall for him üòâ

#### Exhibit F
**One afternoon, Ethan & Lucy had fun recording songs together.** Tune in to our rendition of our favorite worship song ‚ÄúThis Is Living.‚Äù These recording sessions allowed Ethan to seduce Lucy with his amazing singing voice. Even though he was a better singer, Ethan was willing to let Lucy take the spotlight and be the supporting harmony instead of the solo...She took note.

#### Exhibit F
**Senior year | Lucy becomes single | Ethan asks her out | Rejection #1**
April 26, 2018: Ethan makes a ~romantic~ dinner for Lucy (one week before he asked her out). Here you can read the graduation letter that Ethan wrote to Lucy--and see how he hinted at romance. 

#### *Lucy and ethan graduate from Rice and begin their journey anew at Harvard*
This is the story of how we met...again! We somehow both ended up at Harvard, still just friends. In August 2018, Ethan begins dental school and Lucy starts her PhD in neuroscience.

#### Exhibit G
**A prophecy over dim sum.** Shortly after they both moved to Boston, Lucy invited Ethan to have dim sum with her family at the Windsor Cafe in Chinatown (like come on, Lucy, how could you invite the guy you just rejected?!) After the meal, Ethan and the Lai family went for a walk in Boston Common; there, a prophetic moment occurred. They were walking past some pigeons, when Ethan interestingly told Lucy‚Äôs mom the random fact that birds are monogamous. Lucy‚Äôs mom was struck by that statement and had a sudden vision of Ethan & Lucy ending up together someday. From that day forward, Lucy‚Äôs mom prayed for Ethan & Lucy‚Äî-and kept it a secret until they actually got engaged...**FOUR YEARS LATER.**

Here is the photo Lucy‚Äôs mom snuck of Lucy & Ethan looking at the monogamous pigeons. Little did they know, it was indeed a prophetic vision of their future.

#### Exhibit H
**Sweet memories Ethan & Lucy‚Äôs friendship in Boston.** It‚Äôs funny to see in retrospect how ‚Äúdate-y‚Äù their hangouts had always been...Notice Lucy‚Äôs hand position in the photo of them on Ethan‚Äôs D1 boat cruise. What about Ethan‚Äôs hand-drawn birthday card to Lucy? Ah, what a romantic.

#### Exhibit I
**May 14, 2019, Ethan spontaneously asks Lucy to bike to Middlesex Fells Reservation.** As Lucy biked behind Ethan, she wondered what it‚Äôd be like to join Ethan in the adventure of life. At Middlesex Fells, they had a pseudo-picnic date.

#### Exhibit J
**Lucy buys Ethan birthday tickets to see Daniel Caesar.** Ethan once again wondered what Lucy‚Äôs intentions were, looking this hot and taking him out to a concert. Daniel Caesar‚Äôs ‚ÄúBest Part‚Äù now has a special place in their relationship. 

#### Exhibit K
**Lucy invites Ethan to run the Cambridge Half Marathon with her ‚Äúand 20 other friends.‚Äù** Ethan jumped at the invitation and also invited his friend Michael, who is now a groomsman! Lucy made sure Ethan knew he didn‚Äôt get a ‚Äúspecial‚Äù invite by inviting 20 other friends from her PhD program.

#### Exhibit L
**A birthday hiking trip to the White Mountains** in September 2020 is what finally changed Lucy‚Äôs mind about Ethan. She realized how much she missed their conversations and kept sheepishly asking Nicky and Aaron (her two other guys friends on the trip): ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt think I would be good together with Ethan right? RIGHT??‚Äù

### Dating (The Den)
**On October 22, 2020,** Lucy ran 3.5 miles in the house in cold, drizzling rain, to deliver a 6-page handwritten letter confessing her feelings to Ethan. A few days later, on October 26, 2020 they officially started dating! 

#### Exhibit A
**Ethan and Lucy‚Äôs first ‚Äúreal date‚Äù** was a wintery walk through Jamaica Pond and breakfast at at diner near Middlesex Fells reservation! They reflected on all their "friend" interactions and Lucy admitted that she had ignored the "vibes" all along.

### Engaged (The Cabin Room)
When lucy finally signaled to me that she was ready to be engaged, we only had two weeks together in Boston before I left for Naval officer school, and lucy left to London for the summer. Since surprise was my number priority, I knew it was stupid to propose in those two weeks. But I also didn‚Äôt have any military leave to go to London, so the only alternative was to wait until she came back after the summer, which then would also have zero surprise element because if either one of us showed up to Chicago or Boston, she‚Äôd immediately know it was proposal time.

So my only option was to hope against hope, and ask the US government for permission to go to London‚Ä¶in the middle 
Of officer training. With that dream in mind, I began to make the plan.

Phase 1 involved setting up the surprise in London. It was extremely difficult to plan, because I had no idea when and if the Navy would let me go, and Lucy was constantly traveling throughout Europe. So I just had to randomly pick some dates and hope that Lucy was in London.  I googled the email of the professor Lucy was working with in London, and he replied! He and I devised a plan to invite Lucy to a fake soir√©e to which when she showed up to, i would be waiting for her.

Back to officers school, in the middle of my chiefs yelling at me constantly, I found time to ask for permission to go to London. Finally two weeks before the anticipated date I had accumulated 48 hours of military leave and obtained permission to travel internationally. 

Fast forward to July 23, my flight to London was scheduled for 11 PM. I prayed for no delays and fortunately everything looked OK when I was the first one to board my plane at 10 PM. I quicjly fell asleep, but to my horror when I awoke at midnight, the plane was still on the ground and had headed back to our gate it turned out that the plan was having mechanical issues and could not take off. Desperately I asked to get off the plane to see if there were any other flights I could take planning with them saying I have 48hours and I‚Äôm going to London to propose to my girlfriend. They let me off and I proceeded to run around the airport seeing what was available it turned out. There was one other plane flying at 4 AM so I ran to that gate. Unfortunately, the plane was full and there were now two plane loads worth of people trying to fly on one plane. I got on the waiting list, but they told me not to have my hopes up. The plane started boarding and I watched I started begging people in line to let me buy their ticket off of them, but nobody said yes. The last person boarded and the gate to keep her close the doors that was when I knew I had to send it, and I ducked into the ropes, went up to the gate keeper and asked him if he could go back onto the plane and see if they were any empty seats. by some miracle he obliged and ran into the plan few minutes later he emerge from the plane and said there was one empty seat. I was still 15th on the waiting list but because he knew I was active duty military he printed out one more morning ticket for me on the last seat.

When I finally arrived in London, the plan was executed beautifully. Thanks for the help of friends in London. Josh brought me from the airport to Jilly‚Äòs house to quickly change and shower and then went to booking for 29 a bougie wine bar where the surprise was set, the waitresses seated me at a table with a bottle of wine and I waited for Lucy to arrive for the soir√©e. I‚Äôll never forget her look of shock and her drop the moment she saw him in disbelief that I was there in London. We shared a glass of wine, and from there, Josh chauffeured us to Primrose Hill as we walked up the hill three friends were stationed a walking path to hand. Lucy three sets of letters, one representing the present past and the future letters I had written to Lucy to describe our friendship, dating and future married life, when we got to the top of the hill that overlook the city of London, picnic blanket and photographer was waiting for us and I took a knee here and my previous existence take it to you will you marry me, Lucy Lai?
