In this post, I will speculate on the following thought:

Can we ever be "unbiased"

As scientists, no
As humans, no

All of life, as with scinece, must be understood from a lens

"I believe in Christianity as I believe that the Sun has risen, not only because I see it but because by it, I see everything else"
