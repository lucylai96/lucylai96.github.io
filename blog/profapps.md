# All About Teaching Professorships
## Written: May 2025

I always dreamed of the day I would write my second "All About" guide, and I am so happy that day has finally come ü•π If you've visited my site before, chances are you've seen my [All About PhD Applications](https://lucylai.com/blog/gradapps) post, which is a step-by-step advice guide on how to apply for STEM PhD programs. As the title suggests, this post is about how to find and apply for _teaching-focused_ faculty positions, which are becoming increasingly common at many US universities. 

For context, I recently shared that I will be starting a tenure-track teaching faculty position in the Department of Cognitive Science at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) in July 2025. In many ways, this has been my dream job ever since I decided I wanted to be a professor at the age of 17. So needless to say, I am so excited! If you want to read a more personal reflection on my decision to apply to teaching-focused faculty positions (or rather, position...more on that later), I'd recommend [this Substack post]. But if you are more interested in a "how-to" advice guide for applying to such positions, you are in the right place!  

First things first, here are all of my **application materials** at the time of applying:

[CV](http://lucylai.com/files/ucsd/lai_teaching_cv.pdf) ¬∑ [Cover Letter](http://lucylai.com/files/ucsd/lai_coverletter.pdf) ¬∑ [Teaching and Research Statement](http://lucylai.com/files/ucsd/lai_scholarly_activities.pdf) ¬∑ [Diversity Statement](http://lucylai.com/files/ucsd/lai_diversity.pdf)  ¬∑ [Teaching Evaluations](http://lucylai.com/files/ucsd/lai_teaching_excellence.pdf) 

Please feel free to reach out via email if you want to chat about the process. I benefitted immensely from talking to others who went down this path, as well as those who publically shared their application materials, such as [Suraj Rampure](https://rampure.org/tf-app-materials) and [Sam Lau](https://lau.ucsd.edu/). This is how I pay it forward!

_**A quick disclaimer:**_ For a variety of personal reasons, I went on the job market in Jan 2023 and only applied to 1 job. Please keep that in mind as you read this guide, as I'll be the first to admit that my single data point may not representative of the overall process of applying to teaching-focused positions at other schools. So for context, [this was the specific job posting](https://apol-recruit.ucsd.edu/JPF03424) that I applied to.

Before I start, I also want to put in a plug for [this excellent article](https://www.chronicle.com/article/on-the-teaching-tenure-track) written by [Ashley Juavinett](), which covers many of the same topics as well as her personal experience applying to teaching-focused jobs. Ashley is a tenured Associate Teaching Professor of Neurobiology at UCSD School of Biological Sciences and was an instrumental resource for me when I first started exploring these types of jobs. Ashley, if you're reading this, thank you for being the first person to encourage me to go down this path!

With all that being said, let's get started!

## Introduction
### What are teaching track positions?
There are a wide variety of teaching-focused roles that vary in their (1) job security (2) pay and (3) teaching load (or expected time distribution of teaching, research, and service). These roles typically come under the following titles: "lecturer," "teaching professor," "professor of instruction," or even "clinical professor" (I know, confusing). As Ashley mentioned in her article, even jobs with the same title can vary in their degree of job security, pay, and teaching load, so it's very important to read the job description and even talk to people currently in the role at the school to uncover how the particular role treats the three key elements that I listed up front. Knowing this, I will instead discuss what to look for when it comes to these three main elements of a teaching-focused faculty position. 

#### Job security



Here, I‚Äôll use ‚Äúteaching professor‚Äù to describe jobs that include a significant amount of college teaching and a potential for job security.

In recruiting for these tenure-track jobs, some universities are looking almost exclusively for a candidate to teach, while others also want someone who can direct discipline-based education research or fill a leadership role in the department. Whatever the position‚Äôs particular mix of teaching, research, and service, the priority in hiring is almost always the department‚Äôs teaching needs.

Some science departments hire faculty members with formal training in an education field (often a doctorate or postdoctoral work) and embed them in the department. These faculty members ‚Äî coined ‚Äúscience faculty with education specialities‚Äù (SFES), and often on the tenure track ‚Äî teach and work on a variety of educational projects, such as curricular reform.

While the typical tenure track at a large university evaluates people mostly on their research, faculty members on the teaching tenure track have different job expectations. Besides teaching, we focus on developing pedagogical methods and understanding how students learn. We serve on campus committees alongside our research-focused colleagues. In the UC system, teaching takes up about two thirds of our time. The remainder is devoted to service and scholarly work.
