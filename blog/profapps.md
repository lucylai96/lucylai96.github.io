# All About Teaching Professorships
## Written: May 2025

I always dreamed of the day I would write my second "All About" guide, and I am so happy that day has finally come 🥹 If you've visited my site before, chances are you've seen my [All About PhD Applications](https://lucylai.com/blog/gradapps) post, which is a step-by-step advice guide on how to apply for STEM PhD programs. As the title suggests, this post is about how to find and apply for _teaching-focused_ faculty positions, which are becoming increasingly common at many US universities. 

For context, I recently shared that I will be starting a tenure-track teaching faculty position in the Department of Cognitive Science at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) in July 2025. In many ways, this has been my dream job ever since I decided I wanted to be a professor at the age of 17. So needless to say, I am so excited! If you want to read a more personal reflection on my decision to apply to teaching-focused faculty positions (or rather, position...more on that later), I'd recommend [this Substack post]. But if you are more interested in a "how-to" advice guide for applying to such positions, you are in the right place!  

First things first, here are all of my **application materials** at the time of applying:

[CV](http://lucylai.com/files/ucsd/lai_teaching_cv.pdf) · [Cover Letter](http://lucylai.com/files/ucsd/lai_coverletter.pdf) · [Teaching and Research Statement](http://lucylai.com/files/ucsd/lai_scholarly_activities.pdf) · [Diversity Statement](http://lucylai.com/files/ucsd/lai_diversity.pdf)  · [Teaching Evaluations](http://lucylai.com/files/ucsd/lai_teaching_excellence.pdf) 

Please feel free to reach out via email if you want to chat about the process. I benefitted immensely from talking to others who went down this path, as well as those who publically shared their application materials, such as [Suraj Rampure](https://rampure.org/tf-app-materials) and [Sam Lau](https://lau.ucsd.edu/). This is how I pay it forward!

_**A quick disclaimer:**_ For a variety of personal reasons, I went on the job market in Jan 2023 and only applied to 1 job. Please keep that in mind as you read this guide, as I'll be the first to admit that my single data point may not representative of the overall process of applying to teaching-focused positions at other schools. So for extra context, [this was the specific job posting](https://apol-recruit.ucsd.edu/JPF03424) that I applied to.

Before I start, I want to put in a plug for [this excellent article](https://www.chronicle.com/article/on-the-teaching-tenure-track) written by [Ashley Juavinett](https://ashleyjuavinett.com/), an tenured Associate Teaching Professor of Neurobiology at UCSD School of Biological Sciences. Ashley's article covers many of the same topics as this guide as well as her personal experience applying to teaching-focused jobs. Ashley, if you're reading this, thank you for being the first person to encourage me to go down this path!--you were an instrumental resource for me when I first started exploring these types of jobs. 

With all that being said, let's get started!

## Introduction
### What are teaching track positions?
There are a wide variety of teaching-focused roles that vary in their (1) job security (2) pay and (3) teaching load (or expected time distribution of teaching, research, and service). These roles typically come under the following titles: "lecturer," "teaching professor," "professor of instruction," or even "clinical professor" (I know, confusing). As Ashley mentioned in her article, even jobs with the same title can vary in their degree of job security, pay, and teaching load, so it's very important to read the job description and even talk to people currently in the role at the school to uncover how that particular job treats the three key elements that I listed up front. Knowing this, I will instead discuss what to look for when it comes to these three main elements of a teaching-focused faculty position. 

### Types of institutions
But before I talk about that, I think it's important to highlight that there are many different types of institutions of higher education in the U.S. While many ambitious high school students are vying for Harvard, Stanford, MIT, etc., the majority of students in U.S. do not attend R1 institutions. In fact, about **95% of 4-year degree granting institutions in the U.S. are _NOT_ R1 research universities!** 

In case you are unfamiliar with [Carnegie Classifications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Classification_of_Institutions_of_Higher_Education), R1 universities are doctoral-granting schools with "very high research activities." Harvard, Stanford, etc. and other well-known top schools fall into this category. But besides these well-known schools, there are also many R2 and R3 universities with "high" and "moderate" research activity, respectively. Some examples include California State Universities, Chapman University, Stevens Institute of Technology, and Wake Forest University. 

Beyond those, there are also Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUI), which are, as they sound, colleges that primarily enroll undergraduates and have little to no graduate programs. These include Liberal Arts Colleges (LACs) such as Williams, Swarthmore, Amherst, Wellesley, Bowdoin, the Claremont Colleges (Pomona, Harvey Mudd, Claremont McKenna, etc.), as well as Community Colleges (CCs). 

My main point here is, all of these types of institutions are potential places to establish a teaching-focused career.

#### Job security
Academic "tenure" was first established in the U.S. in the early 1900s as a means of defending academic freedom and ensuring job security for faculty members who expressed unpopular or controversial views. In modern practice, a newly hired faculty member must prove that they deserve the life-long job security of tenure by publishing high-impact research within the first 6-7 years of their job. At most R1 institutions, tenure is awarded almost entirely on research output, and therefore teaching-focused faculty (usually called "lecturers" within R1 institutions) do not have the oppourtunity to get tenure.

In recent decades, 

Historically, universities have relied on professors to do both research and teaching and this is how the tenure-track a structured career path for academics, began in the United States in the early 20th century. It evolved from a need to protect academic freedom and ensure long-term job security for professors.
