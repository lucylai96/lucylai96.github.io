# All About Tenure-Track Teaching Positions
## Written: May 2025

I always dreamed of the day I would write my second "All About" guide, and I am so happy that day has finally come ðŸ¥¹ If you've visited my site before, chances are its because you once read my [All About PhD Applications](https://lucylai.com/blog/gradapps) post, which is a step-by-step advice guide on how to apply for STEM PhD programs.  

CVâ€“-Teaching Statement--Research Statement-- 

If youâ€™ve stumbled upon this page, thereâ€™s a good chance youâ€™re interested in applying to teaching positions in computer science or data science. If thatâ€™s the case, I hope the information here is of use to you. It may be particularly helpful for candidates applying without PhDs.

The first section of this page has my most recent application materials, from when I was on the job market in Fall 2024. The second section of this page has the application materials from when I did a broader search in Fall 2021, while still enrolled in my MS program.

Feel free to reach out via email if you want to chat about the process (or even just to tell me that you looked at this page!). I benefitted immensely from talking to others who went down this path in the months leading up to the application cycle.

Welcome! This popular guide on how to apply to PhD programs in STEM has been visited over **100k times** (as of December 2024). Thank you to all who reached out to me over the years telling me how helpful of a resource it was to you / how it helped you get into grad school, and it's been super fun meeting some of you in person at conferences, too! ðŸ™‚

### Quick links
* This guide now has a [video companion](https://youtu.be/fQP1rXzZbbQ)!
* My application materials are **[free to download](https://lucylai.com/files/phd_apps.zip)**. This file contains:
  * my CV at time of application (Fall 2017)
  * my Harvard, Stanford, and NYU essays, chosen in particular to illustrate (1) how little they differ, and (2) what a diversity / personal history statement looks like (NYU)

***Hello friends!*** Iâ€™ve been meaning to write this post ever since I completed the entire grad school application cycle, and Iâ€™ve finally gotten around to it (in time for the beginning of the next cycle, yay!) ðŸ™‚ My earnest hope is for this post to shed some light on the application process, especially since it seems a little black box-y when just getting started.

I have broken up this post into short, digestible, FAQ-like sections for your convenience, with links from the Table of Contents:

## General application tips
Before I begin this section, I want to say that many great student bloggers and professors have already written extensively on this topic, so a quick Google search in your discipline of choice should lead you to many resources about general advice on preparing and applying for grad school.
