# All About Teaching Professorships
## Written: May 2025

I always dreamed of the day I would write my second "All About" guide, and I am so happy that day has finally come ðŸ¥¹ If you've visited my site before, chances are its because you've seen my [All About PhD Applications](https://lucylai.com/blog/gradapps) post, which is a step-by-step advice guide on how to apply for STEM PhD programs. As the title suggests, this post is about how to find and apply for _teaching-focused_ faculty positions, which are becoming increasingly common at many US universities. 

For context, I recently shared that I will be starting a tenure-track teaching faculty position in the Department of Cognitive Science at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) in July 2025. In many ways, this has been my dream job ever since I decided I wanted to be a professor at the age of 17. So needless to say, I am so excited! If you want to read a more personal reflection on my decision to apply to teaching-focused faculty positions (or rather, position...more on that later), I'd recommend [this Substack post]. But if you are more interested in a "how-to" advice guide for applying to such positions, you are in the right place!

First things first, here are all of my application materials at the time of applying:

[CV](http://lucylai.com/files/ucsd/lai_teaching_cv.pdf) Â· [Teaching and Research Statement](http://lucylai.com/files/ucsd/lai_scholarly_activities.pdf) Â· [Diversity Statement](http://lucylai.com/files/ucsd/lai_diversity.pdf)  Â· [Teaching evaluations](http://lucylai.com/files/ucsd/lai_teaching_excellence.pdf) 

Please feel free to reach out via email if you want to chat about the process. I benefitted immensely from talking to others who went down this path, as well as those who publically shared their application materials, such as [Suraj Rampure](https://rampure.org/tf-app-materials) and [Sam Lau](https://lau.ucsd.edu/). This is how I pay it forward!

_**A quick disclaimer:**_ For a variety of personal reasons, I went\* on the job market in Jan 2023 and only applied to 1 job. Please keep that in mind as you read this guide, as I'll be the first to admit that my single data point may not representative of the overall process of applying to teaching-focused positions at other schools. So for context, [this was the specific job posting](https://apol-recruit.ucsd.edu/JPF03424) that I applied to.
