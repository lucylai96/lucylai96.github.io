Lucy Lai has been incredibly helpful to my PhD application process. As an international student unfamiliar with the neuroscience field in the US, I came to her seeking guidance for direction. She has thorough knowledge of neuroscience programs and labs in the US and provided advice that really aligned with my background and interests. She even pointed me to specific programs and multiple PIs closely related to my research interest. Additionally, she helped me refine my CV and personal statement, offering insights into what the admissions committee might be looking for.
