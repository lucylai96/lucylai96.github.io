# Lessons learned from Head TF-ing at Harvard
## Course design, problem sets, and teaching GenEd 1125: Artificial and Natural Intelligence

This post is about my experience as a TF (teaching fellow) for Harvard's GenEd 1125: Artificial and Natural Intelligence in Spring 2021 and 2022 (as Head TF).

### A bit of background
This course was the brain child of Prof. [Venki Murthy](), a professor in the department of Molecular and Cellular Biology. In years past, he had taught a Freshman Seminar on a similar topic, which met 1x/week. In Spring 2021, he decided to turn it into a semester-long General Education course called "Artificial and Natural Intelligence" and reached out to me to be a part of his inaurgural teaching team. 

I've had a good amount of teaching experience throughout both undergrad and grad school, both as a teaching assistant and instructor-of-record (developing and teaching my own courses), and was excited about being a part of a new course at the intersection of two fascinating topics near and dear to my heart. So naturally, I immediately said "YES!"


### Spring 2021
The first run of a course is always somewhat of a rough-cut: at best, things match your minimum viable expectations, and at worst, students are vehemently dissatisfied. Given that the first run of the course was during a global pandemic and therefore all online, I think we did a decent job. The feedback we recieved from students was really helpful for the next year, and since I didn't have much control or oversight of how the first year of the course was organized or implemented (I was not yet Head TF), I will focus this section on the rfeedback recieved from students in Spring 2021, and how we (Venki and I) took that feedback to change the course substatially in Spring 2022.

#### S21 Feedback
Taking student feedback from the Harvard "Q" course evaluations, I split comments into:
1. Positive aspects of course
2. Continue to do
3. Needs improvement

In their evaluation,s students answered 4 questions: 
* What were the strengths of this course? Please be specific and use concrete examples where possible.

Summary
People liked how we meshed the two topics 
To continue:
Open-book exams
Make sections an opportunity to get to know other students
Discussion component of section


* How could this course be improved? Please use concrete examples where possible and provide constructive suggestions.

Summary
More high level and do less content
Better written problem sets
Better section structure
More feedback


* In your opinion, what preparation or background is necessary to take this course?
* What did you take away from your experience in this course? What did you learn? How did this course change you?

"Teaching from within"
Quotes
> Teaching, like any truly human activity, emerges from one's inwardness, for better or worse. As I teach I project the condition of my soul onto my students, my subject, and our way of being together. The entanglements I experience in the classroom are often no more or less than the convolutions of my inner life. Viewed from this angle, teaching holds a mirror to the soul. If I am willing to look in that mirror and not run from what I see, I have a chance to gain self-knowledge-and knowing myself is as crucial to good teaching as knowing my students and my subject.

> We need to open a new frontier in our exploration of good teaching: the inner landscape of a teacher’s life. To chart that landscape fully, three important paths must be taken–intellectual, emotional, and spiritual–and none can be ignored. Reduce teaching to intellect and it becomes a cold abstraction; reduce it to emotions and it becomes narcissistic; reduce it to the spiritual and it loses its anchor to the world. Intellect, emotion, and spirit depend on each other for wholeness. They are interwoven in the human self and in education at its best, and we need to interweave them in our pedagogical discourse as well. 
> By intellectual I mean the way we think about teaching and learning–the form and content of our concepts of how people know and learn, of the nature of our students and our subjects. By emotional I mean the way we and our students feel as we teach and learn–feelings that can either enlarge or diminish the exchange between us. By spiritual I mean the diverse ways we answer the heart’s longing to be connected with the largeness of life–a longing that animates love and work, especially the work called teaching

> My evidence for this claim comes, in part, from years of asking students to tell me about their good teachers. Listening to those stories, it becomes impossible to claim that all good teachers use similar techniques: some lecture non-stop and others speak very little, some stay close to their material and others loose the imagination, some teach with the carrot and others with the stick.
> But in every story I have heard, good teachers share one trait: a strongsense of personal identity infuses their work. “Dr. A is really there when she teaches,” a student tells me, or “Mr. B has such enthusiasm for his subject,” or “You can tell that this is really Prof. C's life.” One student I heard about said she could not describe her good teachers because they were so different from each other. But she could describe her bad teachers because they were all the same: “Their words float somewhere i n front of their faces, like the balloon speech in cartoons.” With one remarkable image she said it all. Bad teachers distance themselves from the subject they are teaching–and, in the process, from their students

I have no question that students who learn, not professors who perform, is what teaching is all about. Students who learn are the finest fruit of teachers who teach. Nor do I doubt that students learning diverse and wondrous ways, including ways that bypass the teacher in the classroom and ways that require neither a classroom nor a teacher! But I am also clear that in lecture halls, seminar rooms, field settings, labs, and even electronic classroom---places where most people receive most of their formal education---teachers possess the power to create conditions that can help students learn a great deal---or keep them for learning much at all. Teaching is the intentional after creating those conditions and good teacher requires that we understand the inner sources of both the intent and the act.

> GOod teaching cannot be reduced to a technique, good teaching comes from the identity and integrity of the teacher
