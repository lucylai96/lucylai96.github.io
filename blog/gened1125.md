# Lessons learned from Head TF-ing at Harvard
## Course design, problem sets, and teaching GenEd 1125: Artificial and Natural Intelligence

This post is about my experience as a TF (teaching fellow) for Harvard's GenEd 1125: Artificial and Natural Intelligence in Spring 2021 and 2022 (as Head TF).

### A bit of background
This course was the brain child of Prof. [Venki Murthy](), a professor in the department of Molecular and Cellular Biology. In years past, he had taught a Freshman Seminar on a similar topic, which met 1x/week. In Spring 2021, he decided to turn it into a semester-long General Education course called "Artificial and Natural Intelligence" and reached out to me to be a part of his inaurgural teaching team. 

I've had a good amount of teaching experience throughout both undergrad and grad school, both as a teaching assistant and instructor-of-record (developing and teaching my own courses), and was excited about being a part of a new course at the intersection of two fascinating topics near and dear to my heart. So naturally, I immediately said "YES!"


### Spring 2021
The first run of a course is always somewhat of a rough-cut: at best, things match your minimum viable expectations, and at worst, students are vehemently dissatisfied. Given that the first run of the course was during a global pandemic and therefore all online, I think we did a decent job. The feedback we recieved from students was really helpful for the next year, and since I didn't have much control or oversight of how the first year of the course was organized or implemented (I was not yet Head TF), I will focus this section on the rfeedback recieved from students in Spring 2021, and how we (Venki and I) took that feedback to change the course substatially in Spring 2022.

#### S21 Feedback
Taking student feedback from the Harvard "Q" course evaluations, I split comments into:
1. Positive aspects of course
2. Continue to do
3. Needs improvement

In their evaluation,s students answered 4 questions: 
* What were the strengths of this course? Please be specific and use concrete examples where possible.
People liked how we meshed the two topics 
To continue:
Open-book exams
Make sections an opportunity to get to know other students
Discussion component of section

* How could this course be improved? Please use concrete examples where possible and provide constructive suggestions.
More high level and do less content
Better written problem sets
Better section structure
More feedback

* In your opinion, what preparation or background is necessary to take this course?
* What did you take away from your experience in this course? What did you learn? How did this course change you?
