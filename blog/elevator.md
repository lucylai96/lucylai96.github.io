Many lay people often ask me 

Most recently, my friend from college told me "I know you do cool stuff, but I never know what the hell you're actually doing?!"

So here is my best attempt to give my research "elevator pitch."

### Doing the best with what we have

a.k.a. understanding human cognition as the optimal use of limited computational resources

Ultimately, I want to understand human cognition. How the brain enables us to think, act, and behave.
This is a challenging problem, because there are infinite amount of mechanisms that can generate any given observation. 

Operates on two assumptions:
(1) The human mind and brain is *rational*
(2) The human mind and brain runs on *limited resources*

My field studies the rational use of limited resources as a unifying principle underlying behavior, expressing it in a new cognitive modeling paradigm called resource-rational analysis.

With this knowledge, we hope to one day reverse engineer cognitive mechanisms and representations. 


Success:
Resource-rational models can reconcile the mind’s most impressive cognitive skills with people’s ostensive irrationality.
