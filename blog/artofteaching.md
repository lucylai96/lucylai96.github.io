# The Art of Teaching 
## Reflections of my teaching philosophy and creative process 

> Good teaching cannot be reduced to a technique, good teaching comes from the identity and integrity of the teacher 

I'm currently in the process of writing my "teaching philosophy" statement for my Bok Teaching Certificate portfolio, but also for [upcoming job applications](/for-hire). Here, I want to do some reflection on my seven years of teaching at the undergraduate and graduate levels, and in particular the theories and ideas that have shaped the way I teach

### Teaching from Within
Quotes
> Teaching, like any truly human activity, emerges from one's inwardness, for better or worse. As I teach I project the condition of my soul onto my students, my subject, and our way of being together. The entanglements I experience in the classroom are often no more or less than the convolutions of my inner life. Viewed from this angle, teaching holds a mirror to the soul. If I am willing to look in that mirror and not run from what I see, I have a chance to gain self-knowledge-and knowing myself is as crucial to good teaching as knowing my students and my subject.

> We need to open a new frontier in our exploration of good teaching: the inner landscape of a teacher’s life. To chart that landscape fully, three important paths must be taken–intellectual, emotional, and spiritual–and none can be ignored. Reduce teaching to intellect and it becomes a cold abstraction; reduce it to emotions and it becomes narcissistic; reduce it to the spiritual and it loses its anchor to the world. Intellect, emotion, and spirit depend on each other for wholeness. They are interwoven in the human self and in education at its best, and we need to interweave them in our pedagogical discourse as well. 

> By intellectual I mean the way we think about teaching and learning–the form and content of our concepts of how people know and learn, of the nature of our students and our subjects. By emotional I mean the way we and our students feel as we teach and learn–feelings that can either enlarge or diminish the exchange between us. By spiritual I mean the diverse ways we answer the heart’s longing to be connected with the largeness of life–a longing that animates love and work, especially the work called teaching

> My evidence for this claim comes, in part, from years of asking students to tell me about their good teachers. Listening to those stories, it becomes impossible to claim that all good teachers use similar techniques: some lecture non-stop and others speak very little, some stay close to their material and others loose the imagination, some teach with the carrot and others with the stick.

> But in every story I have heard, good teachers share one trait: a strongsense of personal identity infuses their work. “Dr. A is really there when she teaches,” a student tells me, or “Mr. B has such enthusiasm for his subject,” or “You can tell that this is really Prof. C's life.” One student I heard about said she could not describe her good teachers because they were so different from each other. But she could describe her bad teachers because they were all the same: “Their words float somewhere i n front of their faces, like the balloon speech in cartoons.” With one remarkable image she said it all. Bad teachers distance themselves from the subject they are teaching–and, in the process, from their students

> I have no question that students who learn, not professors who perform, is what teaching is all about. Students who learn are the finest fruit of teachers who teach. Nor do I doubt that students learning diverse and wondrous ways, including ways that bypass the teacher in the classroom and ways that require neither a classroom nor a teacher! 
> But I am also clear that in lecture halls, seminar rooms, field settings, labs, and even electronic classroom---places where most people receive most of their formal education---teachers possess the power to create conditions that can help students learn a great deal---or keep them for learning much at all. Teaching is the intentional after creating those conditions and good teacher requires that we understand the inner sources of both the intent and the act.


> Faculty often complain that students have no regard for the gifts of insight and understanding that are the true payoff of education---they care only about short-term outcomes in the real world will this major get me a job how will this assignment be useful in real life. 
> But those are not the questions deep in our students hearts. They are merely the questions they have been taught to ask, not only by tuition-paying parents who want their children to be employable but also buy an academic culture that distrust and values into reality. Of course our students are cynical about the inner outcomes of education we teach them that the subjective self is unvalued and even unreal. Your cynicism simply proves that one academic culture dismisses internal truths in honors only the external world students as well as teachers names aren't.
