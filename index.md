### hello!
**I am currently on a year-long "sabbatical" from formal academic work,** where I will be writing, traveling, and tinkering with some creative side projects. If you're interested, you can [follow along my sabbatical journey here](https://sabbatical.lucylai.com/)!

I am lucky enough to spend my sabbatical as a [TSVP Visiting Scholar](https://groups.oist.jp/tsvp){:target="_blank"} at the beautiful [Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology](https://oist.jp){:target="_blank"} in Okinawa, Japan. I recently recieved my Ph.D. in <a href="https://pinphd.hms.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Neuroscience</a> from <a href="http://www.harvard.edu" target="_blank">Harvard</a>, where I was advised by <a href="http://gershmanlab.com/people/sam.html" target="_blank">Sam Gershman</a> and supported by the <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/" target="_blank">NSF Graduate Research Fellowship</a> and a <a href="https://www.28twelvefoundation.org/" target="_blank">Harvey Fellowship</a>. Before that, I received my B.A. in Cognitive Science from <a href="http://www.rice.edu/" target="_blank">Rice University</a>.

Outside of research, I enjoy teaching, writing <a href="http://subcorticalsongs.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">poetry</a>, running, hosting dinner parties, and latin dancing. From 2021-2023, I was a Resident Tutor at <a href="https://quincy.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Quincy House</a>, where I lived with and advised Harvard College students.
