## hello!
***
I am a Ph.D. student at <a href="http://www.harvard.edu" target="_blank">Harvard</a> in the <a href="http://www.hms.harvard.edu/dms/neuroscience/index.html" target="_blank">Neuroscience</a> program, supported by an <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/" target="_blank">NSF Graduate Research Fellowship</a>. I am advised by <a href="http://gershmanlab.webfactional.com/index.html" target="_blank">Sam Gershman</a>.

Previously, I studied <a href="http://cogsci.rice.edu/" target="_blank">Cognitive Science</a>, <a href="http://neuroscience.rice.edu" target="_blank">Neuroscience</a>, and <a href="http://www.caam.rice.edu/" target="_blank">Applied Math</a> at <a href="http://www.rice.edu/" target="_blank">Rice University</a>.

Iâ€™m broadly interested in theories of learning: how do our <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/principles-neural-design" target="_blank">intricately-designed</a> brains allow us to interact with and learn from the world? What makes our learning capabilities better (or worse!) than the best artificial intelligence? I attempt to answer these questions using tools from computational, cognitive, and systems neuroscience. Besides [research](./research.html), I enjoy [teaching](./teaching.html), playing the piano, running, <a href="http://lucyblogs.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">writing</a>, <a href="http://subcorticalsongs.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">stuff</a>, coffee, and classical music (I've recently been obsessed with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Scriabin" target="_blank">Alexander Scriabin</a>).
