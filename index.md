## hello!
***
I am an incoming Ph.D. student in the [Harvard Program in Neuroscience](http://www.hms.harvard.edu/dms/neuroscience/index.html). Previously, I studied [Cognitive Science](http://cogsci.rice.edu/), [Neuroscience](http://neuroscience.rice.edu), and [Computational and Applied Mathematics](http://www.caam.rice.edu/) at [Rice University](http://www.rice.edu/). Iâ€™m interested in multisensory perception, sensorimotor integration, and Bayesian models of behavior. Besides [research](./research.html), I enjoy [teaching](./teaching.html), playing the piano, running, [writing poetry](http://subcorticalsongs.wordpress.com/), and classical music.
