## hello!
***
I am a Ph.D. student at [Harvard](http://www.harvard.edu) in the [Neuroscience](http://www.hms.harvard.edu/dms/neuroscience/index.html) program, supported by an [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). I am advised by [Sam Gershman](http://gershmanlab.webfactional.com/index.html). 

Previously, I studied [Cognitive Science](http://cogsci.rice.edu/), [Neuroscience](http://neuroscience.rice.edu), and [Computational and Applied Mathematics](http://www.caam.rice.edu/) at [Rice University](http://www.rice.edu/). Iâ€™m broadly interested in questions at the intersection of cognitive and systems neuroscience. Besides [research](./research.html), I enjoy [teaching](./teaching.html), playing the piano, running, [writing poetry](http://subcorticalsongs.wordpress.com/), and classical music.

*I recently wrote a blog post about the (neuro)science PhD application process! You can read it [here](https://lucyblogs.wordpress.com/2018/08/02/all-about-phd-applications/).*

You can email me at lucylai (at) g (dot) harvard (dot) edu.
