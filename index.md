## hello!

I am an incoming Ph.D. student in the [Harvard Program in Neuroscience](http://www.hms.harvard.edu/dms/neuroscience/index.html). Previously, I studied [Cognitive Science](http://cogsci.rice.edu/), [Neuroscience](http://neuroscience.rice.edu), and [Computational and Applied Mathematics](http://www.caam.rice.edu/) at [Rice University](http://www.rice.edu/). I‚Äôm interested in multisensory perception, sensorimotor integration, and Bayesian models of behavior. Besides research, I enjoy teaching, playing the piano, running, poetry, and classical music.

You can email me at lucylai (at) g (dot) harvard (dot) edu.

## research

My undergraduate research days were spent in the [Yau Lab](http://www.yaulab.com) at the Baylor College of Medicine. There I worked on developing a Bayesian inference model to explain repulsive multisensory cue interactions. I presented this work at SfN 2016, IMRF 2017, and CCN 2017 (&paper).

I also often fled north to escape hot Houston summers‚Ä¶  üôÇ

Thanks to an NSF-REU, I spent some time at MIT working in the lab of Mehrdad Jazayeri. My work there focused on understanding how variability in perception, inference, and memory influences sensorimotor timing.

I spent another summer at the beautiful Janelia Research Campus as a part of the JUS program (which is also how I met these pretty awesome people). There, Josh Dudman taught me to record from neurons, and together we tried to understand how the striatum might represent action kinematics.

## teaching

Teaching is one of my greatest joys. At Rice, I was a teaching assistant for:

* NEUR/PSYC 362: Cognitive Neuroscience (Spring ‚Äô16, ‚Äô17, ‚Äô18)
* NEUR/CAAM 416: Neural Computation (Spring ‚Äô18)
    I contributed a lecture on Bayesian Causal Inference in perception.
* NEUR/BIOC 385: Fundamentals of Neuroscience (Fall ‚Äô16, ‚Äô17)
* STAT 310: Probability and Statistics (Fall ‚Äò16)
* PSYC 203: Intro to Cognitive Psychology (Fall ‚Äô15)
Before I left the Yau Lab, I gave a little tutorial on model building and fitting [slides].

I was also a mentor at BrainSTEM, an after-school neuroscience program at KIPP Sunnyside High School. The program serves to promote interest in STEM and neuroscience to underrepresented minorities.

But by far my favorite teaching endeavor has been COLL 158: ‚ÄúHow Music Plays the Brain.‚Äù I designed and taught 3 semesters of this seminar course on the intersection of music and neuroscience.

‚ÄúStudents will leave this course having developed a greater appreciation for the power of music through dialogues between an age-old art and a budding field of science.‚Äù ‚Äì lofty goals from the course syllabus

So, did I fulfill my promises? üòõ
