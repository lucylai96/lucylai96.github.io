## hello!
***
I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate at <a href="http://www.harvard.edu" target="_blank">Harvard</a> in the <a href="https://pinphd.hms.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Neuroscience</a> program, supported by the <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/" target="_blank">NSF Graduate Research Fellowship</a> and the <a href="https://www.28twelvefoundation.org/" target="_blank">Harvey Fellowship</a>. I am advised by <a href="http://gershmanlab.com/people/sam.html" target="_blank">Sam Gershman</a>. I am also currently a [TSVP Visiting Scholar](https://groups.oist.jp/tsvp){:target="_blank"} with [Gail Tripp](https://groups.oist.jp/hdnu){:target="_blank"} and [Kenji Doya](https://groups.oist.jp/ncu){:target="_blank"} at the beautiful [Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology](https://oist.jp){:target="_blank"}. Previously, I studied Cognitive Science, Neuroscience, and Applied Math at <a href="http://www.rice.edu/" target="_blank">Rice University</a>.

Iâ€™m broadly interested in theories of learning: how do our <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/principles-neural-design" target="_blank">intricately-designed</a> brains enable us to interact with and learn from the world? How do these learning mechanisms break down in psychiatric disease? What makes our learning capabilities <a href="http://gershmanlab.webfactional.com/pubs/Lake17.pdf" target="_blank"> different</a> than the best artificial intelligence systems? How can we enhance the collaboration between artificial and natural intelligence? I attempt to answer these questions using tools from computational, cognitive, and systems neuroscience.

Outside the lab, I enjoy <a href="http://lucy-lai.com/teaching" target="_blank">teaching</a>, running along the Charles, hosting dinner parties, <a href="http://lucyblogs.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">writing</a> <a href="http://subcorticalsongs.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">stuff</a>, and dancing bachata. From 2021-2023, I was a Resident Tutor at <a href="https://quincy.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Quincy House</a>, where I lived with and advised Harvard College students.
