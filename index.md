## hello!
***
I am currently a [TSVP Visiting Scholar](https://groups.oist.jp/tsvp){:target="_blank"} with [Gail Tripp](https://groups.oist.jp/hdnu){:target="_blank"} and [Kenji Doya](https://groups.oist.jp/ncu){:target="_blank"} at the beautiful [Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology](https://oist.jp){:target="_blank"} in Okinawa, Japan. I recently recieved my Ph.D. in <a href="https://pinphd.hms.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Neuroscience</a> from <a href="http://www.harvard.edu" target="_blank">Harvard</a>, where I was advised by <a href="http://gershmanlab.com/people/sam.html" target="_blank">Sam Gershman</a> and supported by the <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/" target="_blank">NSF Graduate Research Fellowship</a> and a <a href="https://www.28twelvefoundation.org/" target="_blank">Harvey Fellowship</a>. Before that, I received my B.A. in Cognitive Science from <a href="http://www.rice.edu/" target="_blank">Rice University</a>.

Iâ€™m broadly interested in theories of learning: how do our <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/principles-neural-design" target="_blank">intricately-designed</a> brains enable us to interact with and learn from the world? How do these learning mechanisms break down in psychiatric disease? What makes our learning capabilities <a href="http://gershmanlab.com/pubs/Lake17.pdf" target="_blank"> different</a> than the best artificial intelligence systems? How can we enhance the collaboration between artificial and natural intelligence? I explore these questions by building models of human behavior  inspired by machine learning and cognitive science.

Outside of research, I enjoy <a href="http://lucy-lai.com/teaching" target="_blank">teaching</a>, writing <a href="http://subcorticalsongs.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">poetry</a>, running, hosting dinner parties, and latin dancing. From 2021-2023, I was a Resident Tutor at <a href="https://quincy.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Quincy House</a>, where I lived with and advised Harvard College students.
