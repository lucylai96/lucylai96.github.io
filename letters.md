## letters of recommendation ✉️
***

Hi there! If you've asked me or are thinking of asking me for a letter of recommendation (LOR), **please read this page in its entirety.**

Helping students succeed and take advantage of oppourtunities (whether it's an internship, grad school, etc.) is one of my greatest joys. However, writing quality LORs takes a lot of time and effort on my part, so I strive to only write letters that will be strong, specific, and meaningful to your application.

### who I write letters for
If you have served on my course staff as a TA or PLA, or have worked with me as a research assistant, **I would be more than happy to write you a recommendation letter**. If you took one of my classes and did well, I will consider writing a letter if you can demonstrate aspects where you went above and beyond in some way (e.g., in your final project), and are certain that there's not another better person for you to ask. If you're not sure whether you fit that description, I encourage you to send me an email ([lai@ucsd.edu](mailto:lai@ucsd.edu)) and briefly tell me what you are applying for, and what you would like me to highlight.

### how to request a letter
Here's how you can request your LOR:

1. If you meet the above criteria, give me a heads up **ASAP** via email after deciding that you want a letter from me, and let me know when your first deadline is. The sooner you let me know, the better (so I can make a mental note of it).
2. Then, start working on your [Recommendation Letter Request](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RBUO8wjLI1xRICTzjUuHDo1dj7VglI4wkSYNaKaDtN8/edit?usp=sharing). Everything you include in this document helps me write you the strongest possible letter! Once you are finished, email this document to me at [lai@ucsd.edu](mailto:lai@ucsd.edu) (either link a Google Doc in your email, or attach it as a PDF).
    * **Please note** that I need this document from you at _**at least 2 weeks**_ before your first deadline.
    * **If you are applying for an opportunity that requires a recommendation that is *NOT* a traditional letter** (e.g., a portal that asks me to answer a few questions about you), please email me with the relevant details.
4. Please try to send me a reminder **one week before your application(s) is due!** I’m usually good at keeping track of things, but we all make mistakes sometimes :-) You are never bothering me by sending me more reminders.

### tips and reminders
- If you need to provide my information, you can use the following:

Lucy Lai<br>
Assistant Teaching Professor <br>
Department of Cognitive Science<br>
University of California San Diego<br>
(936)-978-0836<br>
lai@ucsd.edu

Cognitive Science Building 244<br>
9500 Gilman Drive<br>
La Jolla, CA 92093<br>

- Make sure to **waive your right** to view recommendation letters submitted on your behalf. This will allow me (and your other writers) to speak more honestly. If I’ve agreed to write you a letter, it will likely be strong, so there’s nothing to be worried about!
- Finally, please keep in touch and let me know how things go! I love celebrating my students’ successes, and I also want to know if things don’t turn out the way you hoped. I’ve been on the receiving end of many rejections myself, and I truly believe that the earlier you get used to it, the easier it becomes to handle. Good luck!
