## letters of recommendation
***

Hi there! If you've asked me or are thinking of asking me for a letter of recommendation (LOR), **please read this page in its entirety.**

Helping students succeed and take advantage of oppourtunities (whether it's an internship, grad school, etc.) is one of my greatest joys. However, writing quality LORs takes a lot of time and effort on my part, so I strive to only write letters that will be strong, specific, and meaningful to your application.

### who I write letters for
If you have served on my course staff as a TA or PLA (IA), or have worked with me as a research assistant, **I would be more than happy to write you a recommendation letter**. If you took one of my classes and did well, I will consider writing a letter if you can demonstrate aspects where you went above and beyond in some way (e.g., in your final project), and are certain that there's not another better person for you to ask. If you're not sure whether you fit that description, I encourage you to send me an email ([lai@ucsd.edu](mailto:lai@ucsd.edu)) and briefly tell me (1) what you are applying for, and (2) who else you are considering asking for a letter.

**NOTE:** If you are applying for an oppourtunity that requires a recommendation that is *NOT* a letter (sometimes it's just a portal asking me to answer a couple of questions), please send me an email with information about whats needed.

### how to request a letter
Here's how you can request your LOR and help me write the best letter possible for you:

1. If you meet the above criteria, give me a heads up **ASAP** via email after deciding that you want a letter from me, and let me know what your first deadline is. The sooner you let me know, the better so I can make a mental note.
2. Then, start working on this [Recommendation Letter Request](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RBUO8wjLI1xRICTzjUuHDo1dj7VglI4wkSYNaKaDtN8/edit?usp=sharing) document. Everything you write in this document helps me help you have the highest chances of getting your desired oppourtunity. Once you are finished, email this document to me at [lai@ucsd.edu](mailto:lai@ucsd.edu) (either link the document in your email, or attach it as a PDF). Note that I need this document from you at _**at least**_ 2 weeks before your first deadline.


The few other students I end up writing letters for are students who did extremely well in class and/or went above and beyond in some way. That being said, if you don’t fall into one of these categories, don’t pre-reject yourself - still ask me first!

If I agree to write you a letter, here’s what I need from you, ideally all in a single Google Drive folder shared with rampure@umich.edu:
