## letters of recommendation
***

Hi there! If you've asked me or are thinking of asking me for a letter of recommendation (LOR), **please read this page in its entirety.**

Helping students succeed and take advantage of oppourtunities (whether it's an internship, grad school, etc.) is one of my greatest joys as a professor. However, writing quality LORs takes a lot of time and effort on my part, so I strive to only write letters that will be strong, specific, and meaningful to your application.

### who I write letters for
If you have served on my course staff as a TA or PLA (IA), or have worked with me as a research assistant, **I would be more than happy to write you a recommendation letter**. If you took one of my classes and did well, I will consider writing a letter if you can demonstrate aspects where you went above and beyond in some way (e.g., in your final project), and are certain that there's not another better person for you to ask. If you're not sure whether you fit that description, I encourage you to send me an email (lai@ucsd.edu) and briefly tell me (1) what you are applying for, and (2) who else you are considering asking for a letter.

### how to request a letter
Here's how you can request your LOR and help me write the best letter possible for you:

1. If you meet the above criteria, give me a heads up **ASAP** via email after deciding that you want me to write you a letter, and let me know what your first deadline is (e.g., "Would you be willing to write me a letter? My first deadline is X." will suffice.) The sooner you let me know, the better so I can make a mental note.
2. 2. Then, start working on your Recommendation Letter Request. Everything you write in this document helps me help you have the highest chances of getting your desired oppourtunity. I have read dozens of LORs from being on applications coaching experience, and . Once you are finished, email this document to me at lai@ucsd.edu (either link the document in your email, or attach it as a PDF). Note that I need at _**at least**_ 2 weeks notice 


Once you

Do I have at least a month to write and submit? (Is flexible on a case-by-case basis)
Do you have a plan with reasonable expectations and a list of realistic school choices? (not applicable if you just need a general letter for industry)

Letters as a part of a PhD or NSF Fellowship can take some time and I'd want to sit down and talk with you first. If you are applying solely for Master's degrees, reaching out by email is usually all that's needed.

  Helping students get into grad programs is one of the great joys of teaching, and if I could help everyone who asks, I would!

The few other students I end up writing letters for are students who did extremely well in class and/or went above and beyond in some way. That being said, if you donâ€™t fall into one of these categories, donâ€™t pre-reject yourself - still ask me first!

If I agree to write you a letter, hereâ€™s what I need from you, ideally all in a single Google Drive folder shared with rampure@umich.edu:


### quick links ðŸ”—
Itâ€™s one thing to hear about my teaching from me, but it's often more helpful to hear from students whoâ€™ve taken my classes! If you want to skip the rest of this page and go straight to the receipts ðŸ§¾, here are some recent teaching evaluations from my former students:
- [SET evaluations](https://lucylai.com/files/cogs180_set.pdf) (formerly CAPEs) and [additional student feedback](https://lucylai.com/files/cogs180_survey.pdf) from [COGS 180: Decision Making in the Brain](https://cogs180.github.io/su24/) (UCSD)
- [Teaching evaluations](https://lucylai.com/files/gened1125_teaching.pdf) from [GENED 1125: Artificial and Natural Intelligence](https://gened1125.github.io/spring2024/) (Harvard), a course I helped teach as Head Teaching Fellow (mostly via guest lectures and discussion sections).
- A full list of courses I've taught and their descriptions can be found [here](https://lucylai.com/teaching.html).

### who am I? ðŸŽ“
I earned my Ph.D. in [Neuroscience](https://pinphd.hms.harvard.edu/) from Harvard in 2024, where I worked on [developing computational theories of learning and decision making](https://lucylai.com/files/lai_precis.pdf). Before that, I got my B.A. in [Cognitive Science](https://cogsci.rice.edu/) from Rice University---I'd like to think that I've been a cognitive scientist from the start, which is why I'm ecstatic to be starting my career at the [first cognitive science department in the world](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/about/dept-history.html)! 

As an Assistant Teaching Professor[^1], I focus on designing and teaching high-quality courses that will equip you with fundamental knowledge and skills across several subfields of cognitive science. My [research](https://lucylai.com/research) and [teaching](https://lucylai.com/teaching) background spans neuroscience, psychology, psychiatry, machine learning, and behavioral economics. I'm especially passionate about inclusive and innovative pedagogy, active learning, and using AI to augment (but not replace!) how we learn.
