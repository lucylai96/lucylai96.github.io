## how to request a letter of recommendation from me
***

Hi there! If you've asked me or are thinking of asking me for a letter of recommendation (LOR), **please read this page in its entirety.**

Helping students succeed and take advantage of oppourtunities (whether it's an internship, grad school, etc.) is one of my greatest joys as a professor. However, writing quality LORs takes a lot of time and effort on my part, so I strive to only write letters that will be strong, specific, and meaningful.

If you have served on my course staff as a TA or PLA(IA), or have worked with me as a research assistant, I would be more than happy to write you a recommendation letter. If you took one of my classes and did reasonably well, I will consider writing a letter only if you can demonstrate aspects where you went above and beyond in my course, and are certain that there's not another better person for you to ask.

I will only agree to write a letter if the letter will be strong, specific, and meaningful, ultimately enhancing your application.
I am more than happy to write a letter fro you if you meet the following criteria:
Worked one-on-one with me in either an Internship, TA, IA/Reader, UCSD departmental capacity or other industry involvement.
You are applying to a job/graduate school in the fields of: data science, machine learning, AI, CS, etc.
Do I have at least a month to write and submit? (Is flexible on a case-by-case basis)
Do you have a plan with reasonable expectations and a list of realistic school choices? (not applicable if you just need a general letter for industry)

Letters as a part of a PhD or NSF Fellowship can take some time and I'd want to sit down and talk with you first. If you are applying solely for Master's degrees, reaching out by email is usually all that's needed.

  Helping students get into grad programs is one of the great joys of teaching, and if I could help everyone who asks, I would!


, as those are the students I interact with the most and have the most first-hand knowledge of. The few other students I end up writing letters for are students who did extremely well in class and/or went above and beyond in some way. That being said, if you don‚Äôt fall into one of these categories, don‚Äôt pre-reject yourself - still ask me first!

If I agree to write you a letter, here‚Äôs what I need from you, ideally all in a single Google Drive folder shared with rampure@umich.edu:


### quick links üîó
It‚Äôs one thing to hear about my teaching from me, but it's often more helpful to hear from students who‚Äôve taken my classes! If you want to skip the rest of this page and go straight to the receipts üßæ, here are some recent teaching evaluations from my former students:
- [SET evaluations](https://lucylai.com/files/cogs180_set.pdf) (formerly CAPEs) and [additional student feedback](https://lucylai.com/files/cogs180_survey.pdf) from [COGS 180: Decision Making in the Brain](https://cogs180.github.io/su24/) (UCSD)
- [Teaching evaluations](https://lucylai.com/files/gened1125_teaching.pdf) from [GENED 1125: Artificial and Natural Intelligence](https://gened1125.github.io/spring2024/) (Harvard), a course I helped teach as Head Teaching Fellow (mostly via guest lectures and discussion sections).
- A full list of courses I've taught and their descriptions can be found [here](https://lucylai.com/teaching.html).

### who am I? üéì
I earned my Ph.D. in [Neuroscience](https://pinphd.hms.harvard.edu/) from Harvard in 2024, where I worked on [developing computational theories of learning and decision making](https://lucylai.com/files/lai_precis.pdf). Before that, I got my B.A. in [Cognitive Science](https://cogsci.rice.edu/) from Rice University---I'd like to think that I've been a cognitive scientist from the start, which is why I'm ecstatic to be starting my career at the [first cognitive science department in the world](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/about/dept-history.html)! 

As an Assistant Teaching Professor[^1], I focus on designing and teaching high-quality courses that will equip you with fundamental knowledge and skills across several subfields of cognitive science. My [research](https://lucylai.com/research) and [teaching](https://lucylai.com/teaching) background spans neuroscience, psychology, psychiatry, machine learning, and behavioral economics. I'm especially passionate about inclusive and innovative pedagogy, active learning, and using AI to augment (but not replace!) how we learn.

### my teaching philosophy üë©üèª‚Äçüè´
I've been teaching in college classrooms for the last 10 years, and have spent a lot of time thinking about what it means to be a good teacher, what effective learning looks like, and what kind of classroom environment I want to build. Here's what you can expect if you take a course with me:

- **A structured learning experience** üìö ‚Äî I design my courses to be organized, fair, and clear in their objectives so that you can focus on learning and not logistics. I strive to be transparent in what's expected of you, when assignments are due, and when to expect feedback.
- **A spirit of curiosity** üîç ‚Äî  Too often, science is taught like a list of facts to memorize. But real scientists are motivated by questions and puzzles! I aim to foster that spirit throughout the course, in my lectures, assignments, and even exams.
- **Rigor and intellectual agency** ü§î ‚Äî I want you to leave my courses knowing how to think critically, ask questions, and drive your own learning.
- **Skill-based learning** üõ†Ô∏è ‚Äî It's more important to me that you develop useful, domain-general skills in my courses over memorizing facts for exams. I strive to connect class material to real-world problems and practical skills such as critical thinking, meta-learning, collaboration, and communicating complex ideas.
- **Learning is active and collaborative** ü§ù ‚Äî Get ready to think, talk, write, and work with your peers. We often learn better when we learn together!
- **Feedback goes both ways** üîÅ ‚Äî You‚Äôll receive meaningful feedback on your work, and I‚Äôll ask for your feedback to keep improving the course.
- **You belong here** üåà ‚Äî No matter your background or identity, I want you to feel welcome, heard, and supported in class. I'm committed to doing whatever I can to help every student succeed and grow.

#### Are you going to be designing any new courses? 
Yes! I'm currently in the process of designing two new COGS courses: 

|                 **Course**              | **Description** |
| **COGS 19: Living and Learning with AI** | Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming the way we live, work, and learn. How can we leverage AI‚Äôs potential while preserving human ingenuity and intellectual agency? This course equips students to critically engage with and creatively utilize AI through hands-on experimentation. Students will evaluate AI‚Äôs capabilities and limitations, examine its impact on work, education, and creativity, and develop strategies for its responsible use. |
| **COGS 113: Cognitive Science of Belief** | Beliefs motivate our behaviors: they influence who we vote for, whether we take action against climate change, and what we think happens when we die. How do beliefs form, and how are they influenced by social and cognitive factors? Why do some beliefs persist despite conflicting evidence, while others change? This course explores the mechanisms of belief formation and change through experimental and theoretical perspectives. |

I expect these courses to be offered for the first time starting in the 2026-2027 academic year.

#### Do you require attendence? 
I don't require attendence in my courses, but I strive to make class a valuable use of your time. I put effort into designing interactive, engaging lectures that promote active learning. Not only is this approach more effective for understanding the material, it also means you won‚Äôt need to play catch-up as much if you miss class. That said, I also value flexibility, so all lectures will be recorded and podcasted when possible!

#### Can I do research with you?
Not just yet---but hopefully soon! During my first year at UCSD, I‚Äôll be focused on developing and teaching several courses for the first time, and I want to make sure they are well-prepped and high-quality. As a result, **I will not be recruiting research assistants for the 2025‚Äì2026 academic year** (but stay tuned in case that changes!).

#### I am a PhD student, can you be my main supervisor?
As a teaching-focused faculty member, my first priority is providing high-quality undergraduate instruction. That said, I do maintain an active research agenda working on computational models of learning, decision making, belief change, and human-AI collaboration (you can read more about my research [here](https://lucylai.com/research.html)). While I will be focusing my first year at UCSD on teaching, I'm open to advising or co-advising a very limited number of Ph.D. students in the future through the [Cognitive Science Ph.D. Program](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/graduates/phd-program/index.html). I‚Äôm also happy to serve on dissertation committees where there‚Äôs a good research fit.
